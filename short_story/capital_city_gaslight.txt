	"Get a beam over here quick!" shouted Mr. Donald. "This tunnel's gonna collapse real soon if we can't shore it up." Two men rushed over carrying a large wooden beam between them. They struggled to get the rough wood upright and wedged into place to support the roof of the tunnel.
	"Step back," Mr. Donald growled as he lifted a heavy wooden mallet like a toy. The big man reared back and with one swing knocked the support beam into place. "That's better," he said. "Now get that damn pony under control before she kicks over any more of the supports." The man responsible for the animal looked horrified, but managed to settle her as he led her back towards the surface.
	Henry Donald was a tall man, a few inches over six feet, well muscled with just a bit around his middle beginning to sag with age. His nose was slightly off where it had been broken and improperly set, and his short brown hair was starting to show streaks of gray. He had the scars to prove he'd been digging sewer tunnels all his life, so the other men respected him and probably would've followed him even if the Capital City Gas Light Company hadn't put him in charge.
	"Hey boss. Over here!" Luke his number two motioned him over. "From the sudden air movement after all that commotion, I'd say we just broke through to the catacombs."
	"Better send up for the steam hammer then, Luke. I'm not sure if the old tunnel on the other side is stable enough to blast our way through. Don't want to risk a collapse that could end the whole deal."
	"Right away boss...And boss?"
	"Yeah Luke?"
	"I know today's important to you. If you wanna head out early, I'll stay down here till we finish widening the opening to the catacombs."
	Henry thought about it for a second. Then said, "Thank you Luke. I think I will head out early. Lucy's gonna be real happy. I'll tell her you said hello."
	As Henry stepped out of the sloped entrance to the sewer tunnel, he was struck by how much colder it was up here on the surface with the wind blowing. The sun was beginning to set and the shadow he cast walking up the ramp was twice as tall as he was. He walked over to the temporary wooden shack they'd built only last month, opened the flimsy door and went in. 
	Inside, the shack was divided into sections by thin wooden partitions. He peeled off his stinking work coveralls, encased in grime from the sewers, and moved behind one of the partitions. Henry pulled on a chain hanging from the celling and water fell from the tank on the roof. After a few seconds under the cold water, he dried off and pulled on his street clothes.
	The the stench of the sewers never really washed off, but Henry hoped he was reasonably clean and free from the smell of the city's waste as he left the work site and began the half mile walk home. Passing through the dimly lit side streets he imaged how the city would change when his project was complete. Hopefully the warm glow of gas lamps would make the rougher areas, like the one he lived in, much safer at night. Perhaps it would even attract new businesses. The important sections of town; the business district, the city center, and some of the wealthier residential neighborhoods were already lit at night by the bright blue glow crystals enchanted by magicians from the College of Magic. But glow crystals were too expensive to cover the entire city. Gas lightning was much cheaper, and though it angered the cities magicians to no end, the city council commissioned the newly formed Capital City Gas Light to lay gas lines through the sewers.
	As Henry walked up to the front door of his home, a small two bedroom brick building in the middle of a long line of identical row houses, he thought about how happy Lucy would be when he could finally afford to move into a nicer middle class neighborhood. When he was hired to build the tunnel connecting the gas pumping station to the main sewer line, he received a small share of the company as part of his payment. Once the project was complete he'd have enough money to retire and live in modest comfort, no more back breaking labor and long hours.
	Lucy Donald greeted her father at the door. "Daddy!" she squealed as she threw her arms around him. "You're home early." Henry lifted his daughter into the air without a hint of effort and planted a kiss on her cheek.
	"I could smell your cooking all the way down in the tunnels, and I told the boys we had to stop work right then so I could get home before every hungry tramp in the city came knocking at the door." 
	"Daddy stop!" Lucy complained. "I know good and well the Queen of the Fae herself couldn't make you shut down that site."
	"You got me there darling. I left Luke in charge. Oh, and he wanted to wish you well."
	"That was nice of him." Lucy said as she took her fathers coat and hat. "Have a seat Daddy. I'll bring out some soup while we wait for the roast."
	Henry stared at the small table in the middle of the dining room. The setting looked inviting, the silverware and glass reflecting the dancing firelight, but the warm glow wasn't enough to stave off the sadness he felt at the sight of all the empty chairs. He wished there were six or seven places set around the table, instead of only two. 
	 As Lucy walked in carrying a steaming pot of soup, his stomach growled, snapping him out of his thoughts. Henry looked up and couldn't help but smile at how much Lucy looked like her mother. 14 years ago today he lost his wife, but it was also the anniversary of his daughter's birth, so Henry Donald resolved to enjoy the rest of the evening with the most pleasant company he could imagine.
	The next morning Henry feeling better than he had in a while. His job was almost complete and his dream of a better life for his daughter within his grasp.
