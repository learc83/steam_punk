	"Get a beam over here now!" shouted Mr. Donald. "We're gonna be buried down here if we can't shore up this tunnel." Two men rushed over carrying a large wooden beam between them. They struggled to get the rough wood upright and wedged into place to support the roof.
	"Step back," Mr. Donald growled as he lifted a heavy wooden mallet like a toy. The big man reared back and with one swing knocked the support beam into place. The ceiling stopped shaking. "That's better," he said. "Now get that damn pony under control before she kicks over any more of the supports." The man responsible for the animal looked horrified, but managed to settle her as they walked back towards the surface.
	Henry Donald was a tall man, a few inches over six feet, well muscled with just a bit around his middle beginning to sag with age. His nose was slightly off where it had been broken and improperly set, and his short brown hair was starting to show streaks of gray. He had the scars to prove he'd been digging sewer tunnels most of his life, so the other men respected him and would've listened to him even if the Capital City Gas Light Company hadn't put him in charge.
	"Hey boss. Over here!" Luke, his number two, motioned him over. "From the sudden air movement after all that commotion, I'd say we just broke through to the catacombs."
	"Better send up for the steam hammer then, Luke. I'm not sure if the old passage on the other side is stable enough to blast our way in. Don't want to risk a collapse that could end the whole deal."
	"Right away boss...And boss?"
	"Yeah Luke?"
	"I know today's important to you. If you want to head out early, I'll stay down here till we finish opening up the catacombs."
	Henry thought about it for a second. "Thank you Luke. I think I will head home. Lucy's gonna be real happy. I'll tell her you said hello."
	
	As Henry moved up the sloped entrance to the sewer tunnel, he was struck by how much colder it was up here on the surface with the wind blowing. The sun was beginning to set and the shadow he cast walking up the ramp was twice as tall as he was. He walked over to the temporary wooden shack they'd built only last month, opened the flimsy door and went in. 
	Inside, the shack was divided into sections by thin wooden partitions. He peeled off his stinking work coveralls, encased in grime from the sewers, and moved behind one of the partitions. Henry pulled on a chain hanging from the celling and water fell from a tank on the roof. After a few seconds under the cold water, he dried off and pulled on his street clothes.
	The stench of the sewers never fully washed off, but Henry hoped he was reasonably clean and free from the smell of the city's waste as he left the work site and began the half mile walk home. Passing through the dimly lit side streets he imaged how the city would change when his project was complete. Hopefully the warm glow of gas lamps would make the rougher areas, like the one he lived in, much safer at night. Perhaps it would even attract new businesses. The important sections of town, the business district, the city center, and some of the wealthier residential neighborhoods, were already lit by bright blue glow crystals enchanted by the College of Magic. But glow crystals were too expensive to cover the entire city. Gas lightning was much cheaper, and though it angered the cities magicians to no end, the city council finally commissioned the newly formed Capital City Gas Light to lay gas lines through the sewers.
	Henry walked up to the front door of his home, a small two bedroom brick building connected to of a long line of identical row houses. Looking at his neighbor's broken window, he thought about how happy Lucy would be when he could finally afford move into a nicer middle class neighborhood. When the company hired him to build the tunnel connecting the gas pumping station to the main sewer line, he received a small share of stock as part of his payment. Once the project was complete he'd have enough money to retire and live in modest comfort, no more back breaking labor and long hours. With an early retirement so close he should have been in good spirits, but this day was always bittersweet.
	Before he could reach the knob, Lucy swung the door open. "Daddy!" she squealed as she threw her arms around him. "You're home early." Henry lifted his daughter into the air without a hint of effort and planted a kiss on her cheek.
	"I could smell your cooking all the way down in the tunnels, and I told the boys we had to stop work right then so I could get home before every hungry tramp in the city came knocking at the door." 
	"Daddy stop!" Lucy complained. "The Queen of the Fae herself couldn't make you shut down that site."
	"You got me there darling. Luke volunteered to stay late, so I could surprise you."
	"That was nice of him," she said as she took her fathers coat and hat. "Have a seat Daddy. I'll bring out some soup while we wait for the roast."
	Henry stared at the small table in the middle of the dining room. The setting looked inviting, the silverware and glass reflecting the dancing firelight, but the warm glow wasn't enough to stave off the sadness he felt at the sight of all the empty chairs. He wished there were six or seven places set around the table, instead of only two. 
	 As Lucy walked in carrying a steaming pot of soup, his stomach growled, snapping him out of his thoughts. Henry looked up and couldn't help but smile at how much Lucy looked like her mother. 14 years ago today he lost his wife, but it was also the anniversary of his daughter's birth, so Henry Donald resolved to enjoy the rest of the evening with the most pleasant company he could imagine.
	 Henry and his daughter laughed and talked well into the night, and he went to bed feeling better than he had in a while. He fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.  Soon he was snoring away oblivious to the world, until a loud pounding ripped him from his slumber.  "What is it this time?" he grumbled, as he got up and headed to the door. Luke was standing there when he opened it.
	"What's wrong Luke? You look worried."
	"Boss, we lost Michael Collins in the catacombs."
	"What do you mean lost?" Henry asked.
	"Well, I kept a few of the boys late, so we could get the catacombs opened up before morning. We managed to dig a small hole, but after a bit the steam hammer just seized up and the engineer couldn't get it working again. Mike was the smallest guy there and he thought he could squeeze through to see if it was stable enough for blasting. He made it through, but he said he heard something and went deeper to check it out." 
	"Why the hell did you let him do that?" Henry yelled.
	"I told him not to but, I couldn't stop him," Luke said. "I waited for about an hour and tried to send in a man after him, but no one was small enough to fit. We've been trying to dig out a bigger opening.  Without the steam hammer it'll take a while, though. 
	"Can you hear him?" Henry asked.
	"We've been calling to him, but he hasn't answered. I hope he didn't fall down a hole, or get hurt somehow."
	"Let's hope he just wandered out of earshot, and got lost," Henry reassured him. "We need to get into those catacombs. How soon till they get the steam hammer working again?" 
	"Boss, the engineer says it's going to take at least a week to fix, and we can't get another one out any faster," Luke said.
	"Dammit! I knew using the catacombs as a shortcut for the tunnel was gonna cause problems" Henry said. "The company thought it would save time, but I knew something would go wrong. Always does." He looked Luke straight in the eye. "Cutting corners always--and I mean always, bites you in the ass."
	"What are we gonna do then boss?" Luke asked. "I'm all out of ideas."
	Henry stood there thinking for a moment, trying his best to project confidence while standing in his pajamas. "We're gonna blast our way in."
	"I thought you didn't want to risk blasting?" Luke asked.
	"Given the choices, it's the best option. We can wait a week for the steam hammer, or keep digging by hand, but either way Mike would probably be dead before we found him. Every minute he's lost down there he'll probably wander farther and farther into the catacombs. You run down to the tunnel and get the explosives ready to go. I'll meet you there as soon as I get dressed." 
	"OK boss. I'll get on it," Luke said. He ran off to carry out his orders. Though he still looked tired, the worry was gone from his face. Henry knew that confidence inspired confidence. Years in the sewers and a stint in the army had taught him that. He didn't like the idea of potentially brining down the whole tunnel, but since he was sure this was the best choice he wasn't going to show any hesitation. 
	Henry got dressed as fast as he could.	When he got to the site, the demolition team was already loading the explosives onto the pony cart, but it took them several more hours to get everything ready. Once the charges were in place, Henry rounded everyone up and readied the detonator. 
	Luke spoke up. "Boss, a few of the men said they heard someone screaming from inside the catacombs a few hours ago. At first I thought it might be Mike, but they said it sounded like a woman."
	"You know how easy miners startle. It was probably just the wind," Henry said. 
	"Maybe your right," Luke agreed. "Still kinda spooky though."
	"Only one way to find out for sure." Henry gave a forced laugh and grabbed the detonator. "Everyone clear we're gonna blow this in 5...4...3...2...1." He pushed the plunger down and a split second later an explosion, still loud even through covered ears, forced a huge cloud of dust up out of the entrance. 
	Henry and his men waited for the dust to clear then they went back down to survey the damage. "Looks like everything's holding up so far," Henry said when he got near the opening to the catacomb. A jagged gash almost the width and height of a man stood were the little hole had been. Henry was surprised by how small the opening was, the rock was much tougher than it should have been, but at least it was big enough to squeeze through standing up. "Luke, grab a lantern and come with me," he said. "The rest of you start checking the supports for damage."
	The two men squeezed through the opening into the unknown. Catacombs stretched through the city, but as far as anyone knew no one had explored this particular section for centuries. In fact no one even knew it existed until one of the company's engineers stumbled upon an obscure map in the city records. The company decided to use it as a shortcut for the gas lines, and if everything went according to plan it could shave months off of the total project time. So far, Henry thought, everything was not going according to plan. 
	When Henry finally pushed through he was standing in an arch shaped tunnel that stretched off in either direction. He noticed the walls first. They were unnaturally smooth, and completely clean. The blast should have coated every surface with a fine layer of dust, but it was as if a static charge was repelling the dirt. When he thought about it, the walls even felt charged. Henry held his hand against the smooth cold rock and closed his eyes; he could almost hear a faint hum. "Magic," he whispered. "This tunnel was carved with magic."
	"I've never seen anything like this before," Luke said. "None of the other catacombs in the city were carved out by magic."
	Henry opened up his lantern and looked down the tunnel. Nothing, but perfectly carved walls as far as he could see, but the floor seemed to slope gently downward in one direction.  "That's probably because there aren't many magicians around with the power to move this much rock." He laughed, "If there were we'd be out of a job."
	"Which way do you think Mike went, boss?" Luke asked.
	"Well, he was young and curious so I'm betting he set off that way," he said pointing in the direction of the downward slope. "Farther down and most likely to lead to trouble." Henry bent down and found a small stone next to the gash made from the blast. He reached back and threw it down the tunnel, listening to the echo as it bounced and rolled down the slope. He waited for the sound to stop, but it just faded away as it tumbled farther. When he could no longer hear the echo, he told Luke, "Well we better get going. Looks like tunnel goes down a ways." They started walking but as soon as they got going, Henry stopped. "Did you hear that?" he asked?
	"Yeah boss, and I don't think it was wind."
	"It almost sounded like someone calling my name," Henry added.
	"I thought it sounded like she was calling me," Luke said shivering a bit. "Maybe it was Mike yelling, and some kinda trick echo?"
	"Whatever it was, it came from down there," he said pointing in the direction they had been going, "so let's pick up the pace." They moved quickly down the slope until, after a few hundred yards, they saw a room carved into the side of the tunnel. The room was a perfect circle, and in the middle, dominating the room, a bleached white skeleton rested on a solid stone platform. His hands laid across his chest clutching a gold scepter, a huge gleaming emerald set into the top, and thick gold bracelets wrapped around his wrists. Arrayed around the room, in alcoves carved into the wall, other skeletons were laid out in a similar manner. Each one wore a small fortune in stunning gemstones and ornate gold jewelry. 
	Henry entered the room first. He'd seen other tombs in the catacombs throughout the city, but he was shocked by how old these remains must have been and by the open display of wealth. Surely people knew of this tomb in the time it was constructed. What had protected this treasure from looters over the centuries? Speechless, Henry walked around to the other side of the stone platform surveying the room. Suddenly his eyes were drawn to the floor next to the platform. It was Michael Collins lying still on the ground. Henry shined the lantern on his face; it was frozen in terror.  His heart pounded as he took in what he saw. 
	"It's Mike!" Henry yelled. "He's dead, and from the look on his face, something must have startled him pretty good," He knelt down to investigate further. Luke quickly joined him, and they both looked over the body. 
	Luke spoke up first, "Boss, I don't have a clue what could've killed him."
	"Nothing I can see either," Henry added. He was perplexed, and the body troubled him. Not that he was particularly close to the boy, but he was responsible for him. Mike might even be alive if Henry hadn't left early the day before. At moments like this it was easy to just sit and sulk, but this wasn't new to him. He'd lost enough men to know beating himself up wouldn't do any good. He wasn't even sure why Mike was dead yet, so he forced himself to concentrate. Second guessing could come later. Right now he had to figure out what happened. 
	He noticed the boy had a small white comb in his right hand, made of some type of bone. "I wonder why he's holding onto this comb?" Henry added as he pried it from his fingers.
	"He didn't have a girl that I know of," said Luke.
	Henry examined the comb. "It's obviously a woman's comb, but from the look of it, I don't think it's the kind of thing a young girl would use," Henry said. "It's too old and beat up." 
	"You know, I think Mike lived with his grandmother. Maybe it belonged to her," Luke suggested.
	"Maybe, but I'm still not sure why he'd bring it down into the tunnels with him." Henry thought for a second then added, "I think I'll take the comb and go see his grandmother. If it is hers, she'll be happy to have it back. In any case I'll have to tell her about Mikes death, and I can ask her if she noticed anything wrong with him that could've caused this."
	"What do you want me to do boss? Luke asked"
	"While I try to figure this out, you see if you can get Mike's body to the coroner and have him examine it. I probably won't be able to get back before dark, so go ahead and send everyone home for the night, as soon as you get Mike out of there. I'll meet you back here in the morning."
 	"Can do," Luke agreed.
	The tenement building Mike's grandmother lived in was only a few blocks away from the job site. She was on the first floor of the brick building and had the small luxury of a private entrance way directly to the street. Before Henry even made it up the small staircase, the door swung open. An old woman was standing in the doorway, talking to a rather pregnant and rather young girl. When the girl noticed Henry she scurried down the steps, clutching a jar of sloshing black liquid. She kept her head lowered to the side to avoid looking at Henry and almost tripped at the bottom.
	"Careful young lady!" he said as he reached out steady her. "You don't want take a tumble in your condition." The old woman at the top of the stairs smirked at his comment, while the girl just mumbled her thanks and hurried off.
	"What are you doing here young man?" the old lady asked. Henry was hardly young, but the woman before him looked old enough to be Mike's great-grandmother. Her hair was held back in a scrawny bun, a few wisps struggling to escape, and her blue dress was out of fashion before Henry was born. "You're scaring away my customers."
	Mike's friends had said the old woman dabbled in unlicensed magic, but he dismissed their stories as idle gossip. Maybe they were right. "Mrs. Collins?" Henry questioned.
	As she looked him over, he felt like a piece of fruit in the market stall. At least she hadn't tried to poke at him yet, he thought with a shudder. "Yes, I am Mrs. Collins. Who are you?"
	"I'm Mr. Donald, Michael's boss. I'm afraid I have some bad news." Henry had done this before, so he almost had a script. "Can I come inside?" He thought he saw a hint of worry on her otherwise stoney expression when she motioned him to follow her in.
	The decor in the small tenement was much nicer than Henry would have expected. The sitting room was neat and orderly, and was lit by the eerie blue light of expensive glow crystals mixed with the afternoon sun. It appeared Mrs. Collins must have made quite a bit of extra money on the side. 
	She motioned for him to sit down on the sofa while she placed a cup of steaming tea on the low table in front of him. Henry had second thoughts about drinking it, but when she poured herself a cup, sitting in a high backed chair across from him, he took a sip.	
	"Mrs. Collins," he said after putting down his tea. "I'm sorry to tell you this, but Michael has passed away. We found him in the catacombs earlier today. We had just broken through, and he went in to scout it out. I apologize for your loss."
	Her shoulders slumped, and she turned her head for a moment. When she looked back at him, her eyes had gone completely cold. She sat there just staring at Henry. The lack of emotion turned his blood as icy as her eyes, but when she spoke up, she couldn't keep the anger from her voice. "Your apologies aren't going to help my grandson. I told that boy not to go digging around in the crypts. He said the money was too good, but I was afraid something might happen down there." Henry thought he saw her hand tremble slightly as she took a sip of tea. "Tell me Mr. Donald, how did he die?" she asked.
	"There wasn't a mark on his body. I was hoping to ask about his health, and about this." He took the comb from his pocket. It was bone white and from the looks, very old. It was covered with scratches and so well used that the teeth were noticeably worn down.
	Mrs. Collins eyes flew to the comb. "Where did you find that?" she asked.
	"He was holding it when we found him."
	"Michael told me that you were about to tunnel into an unknown section of the catacombs. Did you find any graves?" Mrs. Collins inquired.
	"Yes we did. I think they were very old." Henry replied.
	"And has anyone heard a woman's voice calling to them?"
	"Yes...I did. And some of my employees said they heard a woman screaming from inside the catacombs."
	Mrs. Collins looked at Henry. He saw her mask melt away as her face filled with genuine concern. She leaned forward and said, "Mr. Donald. My grandson didn't have any health problems. He was murdered. "
	"Why do you say that?" 
	Mrs. Collins pointed to the comb. "Because that certainly belonged to a Baen Sidhe. Look at how old it is." Henry instinctively dropped the comb on the table. "It's said a Baen Sidhe spends most of her time combing her tangled hair, trying in vain to look beautiful again. The quickest way anger one is to taker her comb, and the stories say a Baen Sidhe always calls her victims by name."
	Henry wasn't a superstitious man, but the look on Michael's face was etched in his mind, and how could she know about the voice he heard calling his name. He listened as she went on. "It's just like you learned as a school boy. Centuries ago, the land was ruled by powerful families of magicians. Then the people overthrew them and the College of Magic was established."
	"What do old history lessons have to do with this?" he asked.
	"Listen young man." Mrs. Collins snarled. "Do you want to learn what I know about my grandson's murderer or not?" Henry stayed quiet and she continued. "That's better. The magical families revered their ancestors immensely. When they realized they were close to defeat, they found a way to protect their ancestral tombs even after they were gone."
	"Some kind of curse?" Henry interrupted.
 	"Not exactly," she replied. "The magicians needed an eternal protector, and they knew that the fae folk live indefinitely. So They developed magic that could bind one of the fae to a tomb forever. Eventually, it grows tired of living locked up in a tomb, but because it's magically bound it can't end its existence. As it loses its mind, it loses its beauty and warps into a twisted Baen Sidhe. Filled with rage, it becomes the guardian of the tomb."
	Henry didn't like the sound of that. "But how could it kill without leaving a scratch?"
	"The fae folk have the power of illusion. This power only grows as the Baen Sidhe ages, until it can cause real damage to the mind by only appearing to harm the body," she answered.
	"So it can make someone believe they have been injured, without physically harming them?"
	"Correct, young man."
	Henry didn't know where the old woman had learned all this, but she seemed to have answers. "Can it be killed?" he asked.
	"The easiest way is to severe its head with cold steel," she said. "That should do it. However, the hard part is getting it to sit still while you do the removing." Mrs. Collins stopped and thought for a while. "The fae hate salt. Maybe you could get it to eat something salty. That might slow it down." She couldn't be serious, he thought.
	"How would you get it to eat?"
	"Not my problem," she said looking straight at Henry, the steel back in her stare. "But Mr. Donald, if you do manage to kill the beast, promise me you'll bring me its eyes."
	"Wait, I was only asking questions. It's not my job to kill it. The College of Magic may not like the work we're doing, but it's their duty to deal with situations like this," he said.
	Mrs. Collins tilted her head slightly, "Young man, I thought you were smarter than that. The College would do anything to stop your project." His heart sank; she was right. The College could use this as an excuse to shut them down until they ran out of money. No could say exactly how long it took to kill a Baen Sidhe after all.
	"You have a point," he conceded.
	"I wouldn't be surprised if the College knew about his all along," she said. "They must have a map of the ancient burial sites."
	Henry's mind raced back to the map. The engineer who found it in the archives quit right after the discovery. He stood up quickly, "Thank you for your time, Mrs Collins, but I should get going," he said. His mind was racing so fast he almost forgot why he was there. "Once again, I am deeply sorry for your loss," he added.
	"This is your responsibility," she called as he headed out the door. Don't remind me, he thought. 
	Henry marched down the street, his pace fueled by his anger. The map was planted by the College of Magic, and he had walked straight into their trap. He should've known better than to go up against an enemy so powerful. He thought he could do some good, for the city and his daughter, but now his dreams were slipping away. By tomorrow, gossip would spread, and he was sure the College would have an investigator out to take charge of the site. What could he do? He dug tunnels; he didn't kill monsters. 
	He kept walking, feeling sorry for himself, until he passed a young girl and her mother, walking the opposite direction. As he passed by, she looked up and smiled at him. He smiled back, and his thoughts turned to Lucy. He thought about her smile. He couldn't stand to tell her that a good school and a safer neighborhood were still out of reach. Then he thought about the other people who would suffer if the company went under; the families of the men who worked for him, and the families that lived along the dark streets. He couldn't let the College of Magic undo so much hard work. The thought of what he had to do terrified him, but he couldn't give up now. It seemed the old woman was right. It was his responsibility. He had to kill the Baen Sidhe--tonight. 
	Henry decided go by his home first, to prepare. It was dark now, so he hoped Lucy would be asleep. He opened the front door, and walked in quietly. Lucy was there waiting for him. He should have expected her to be awake; she always knew when something was wrong, just like her mother. 
	"Daddy, you're late. Did something happen at the site?" she asked.
	"It's fine Darling. We found a big nest of rats in the tunnel, so I came home to get my gun," he answered. "Since you're up, could you get my old army sword down from the mantle?" If she wondered why he needed a sword to kill rats, she didn't ask. By the time he returned from his bedroom with the short stocky flintlock, she already had the sword in its scabbard. 
	The basket hilted sword was designed for both cutting and thrusting, a deadly weapon in the hands of an experienced swordsman. Henry kept it around to remind him of his days in the army, but he never thought he'd have to use it in combat again. He pulled the sword from its sheath, the blade polished to a mirror shine. "Lucy you didn't have to clean it up so good. I kept it oiled, so it just needed dusting off," Henry said.
	"Well Daddy, I already had it clean. I was dusting the mantle this morning, and I thought it could use some attention." 
	"That's a fortunate coincidence," he said, but thought to himself it was more of her mother's uncanny intuition. He sheathed the sword, and Lucy helped him fasten the scabbard to his belt. "Thank you for the help, darling. Now you go get some sleep. I need to get back to the site."
	"Can't you at least stay for tea?" The worry he saw on her face made him pause. What if he never came back? Maybe he should just stay home and accept his fate--at least Lucy wouldn't be in danger of losing her father. But then he thought about the future they would have if the company collapsed. He was getting too old for tunnel jobs, and without steady work, he wouldn't be much use to anyone. Lucy would be better off living with her mother's family in that case. Besides, his plan should work.
	"Afraid I can't. I have work to do, but don't worry, I'll be back before you wake up," he said. As he walked to the door, he grabbed some salt from a bucket they kept near the front steps and wrapped it in a piece of cloth. He turned back to Lucy. "I love you," Henry said.
	"Love you too, Daddy," she replied. "Be careful," she called out as he left.
	"I will, darling," he said walking down the front steps.   	Henry made quick time to the site. He was determined to put an end to this as soon as he could. By the time he got there, the sky was pitch black; all the men had already gone home. He lit his lantern, and walked down the ramp, to the catacomb entrance, not bothering to change into his work coveralls. 
	Henry stood before the gateway to the catacombs, hesitating. He stared at the great tear in the rock, trying to work up the nerve to go on. Then abruptly, he turned sideways and squeezed his way through. As his foot came down on the smooth sloping floor, he heard something. It sounded like it came from farther down, toward were they had found Mike's body. 
	He stood quietly--listening. His ears tried to gather more information, but the only thing he heard now was his own breath and his beating pulse. His heart was racing, pumping adrenaline laced blood as fast as it could. Every instinct screamed at him to turn back. He refused to listen, willing his feet to take him farther down the tunnel. "What have I gotten myself into?" he whispered.
	There it was again. Footsteps, from the darkness, far down into the tunnel. This time he couldn't fight his body's response, and he froze. "It's just a horrible demon creature of the night. I came to hunt it, not the other way around," he reminded himself. It didn't feel like he was doing the hunting, but he continued on. He walked past the room were MIke, had been slain, and shined his light in. All clear. He kept going.
	"Henry..." a woman's voice called. It was clear at first then it faded off into echoes. "I'm here Henry," it called again. It was the same voice he'd heard earlier when he was first in the catacombs, raspy but still fetching; its beauty making it all the more terrifying. The voice was trying to drag him deeper into the tunnel. He had no choice but to follow. He passed two more chambers like the first one.
	"Henry, come to me," it cried. "I'm waiting." The voice faded out again. It was almost as if it could control the echos, stretching its calls out into emptiness. Henry had no way to tell how far down the voice came from, or how far he had walked, but he thought he could see faint glow up ahead a few hundred feet.
	"Henry..."
	"What!" he yelled back as loud as he could, working his fear into a defiant shout. The battle cry cut through the terror. It was enough to let him continue on towards the glow. As he got closer he recognized the light. A glow crystal, very faint after the years, but still going.
	The tunnel opened up into a circular room like the others, but nearly twice as large. On a platform in the middle, the glow crystal rested in a ring on the finger of a very large skeleton. He could hardly believe it was still as bright as it was after centuries trapped in here. The magician who made it must have been extremely powerful. 
	He stepped closer to the room. Other skeletons lay in alcoves like the first room. However, the gold and jewels on display here made the previous crypt look like a paupers grave. Diamonds and rubies glittered on the fingers of long dead nobles, reflecting the light of his lantern back at him. A massive gold crown rested on the head of the central skeleton. Enough wealth to tempt a saint. But he knew that it was off limits, even if he did kill the Baen Sidhe, the College would have someone here to catalog the treasure. They might notice anything missing. 
	Henry entered the room. He heard a rustling sound, and shined his lantern down a tunnel opening in the right side of the room. His blood froze. A shadowy figure ran down the tunnel fleeing the light. He could barely make out an outline, but it was his first glimpse of the Baen Sidhe. How deep did these tunnels go?
	"I don't have all day," he called out. She could keep leading him deeper and deeper forever, he thought. Maybe he could make her come to him. He sat his lantern on the platform in the middle of the room, and pulled out the comb. He was probably doing something very stupid, but he had to end this chase. "Do you want this back?" he yelled, holding up the comb in one hand and his gun in the other.
	A moan rang out from the darkness. A piercing wail that filled Henry with dread. He had its attention. He steeled himself and cried out, "better come and get it." Then he tossed the comb on the ground. The creature wailed again--louder, closer. The voice almost broke his resolve. It took everything he had not to lie down and curl up.
	The moan stopped. Then started again, but from the tunnel he had just came from. He cocked his gun and turned around to face it. The voice grew louder until it seemed to shut down his senses. It was in the room. The creature threw him down. He saw a blinding flash as he slammed into the ground. His mind was blank. He struggled to reorient himself, but he couldn't stand. He sat there on the ground, dazed. Then the taste of blood, from the deep gash on his cheek, snapped him back to his senses.
	His lantern was out, and his eyes hadn't adjusted to the dim glow crystal. He fumbled for one of the emergency flares in his jacket pocket. It burst into flame. His eyes snapped to the center of the room. There it was, the Baen Sidhe herself, reaching over to pick up her comb. She was dreadful, bathed in the red glow of the flare. Her long gown was torn to tatters, and her skin stretched tight over her bones. Her hair was wild and flailed about even though the air was still. Her fingernails were so long, she almost couldn't grasp the comb. She managed to pick it up and stood, staring at it.
	Henry saw his gun. He reached over and grabbed it. The Baen Sidhe snapped her head towards him and met his gaze. It's eyes glowed like red coals, illuminating the black depths of her eye sockets. Henry raised the gun to his shoulder and took aim. "You don't even know what this is do you?" he said in a low growl. How could she, guns weren't around when she was locked down here. She crouched, ready to pounce and tear him apart.
	He pulled the trigger. The hammer slammed down igniting the priming powder, and the main charge exploded, hurling a handful of rock salt towards the creature. In a split second the salt buried itself deep in her chest.
	The Baen Sidhe shrieked in pain. Her wailing filled the chamber with a solid wall of sound. Henry threw down his gun and instinctively covered his ears. She writhed and tore at her chest, trying in vain to remove the salt. It seemed that a Baen Sidhe would greatly disliked having salt lodged in its skin.
	He wasn't sure how long it would take her to recover, so he drew his sword and walked toward the creature. Henry's vision blurred for a second. Suddenly were there had been a hideous beast, his wife now stood.
	"Henry, what are you doing? Put down the sword," she pleaded. He looked around. He was back in his house, and his wife was there lying down on the bed. She was injured.
	"What...happened to you?" he asked, distraught.
	"You shot me, dear."
	"Why would I do that?" He sounded shocked.
	"It doesn't matter, I'll be fine," she assured him. "Now put down the sword, and come over here." He looked down at his sword, about to throw it down, but something reflecting in the mirror shine caught his eye. He looked harder. His wife's reflection, it didn't match the illusion. He closed his eyes. This wasn't his wife at all. She had been gone for 14 years. It was a trick. He walked over to the bed, still holding the sword.
	"Dear, what's wrong?" the Baen Sidhe asked. 
	"Nothing, darling," he said, raising the sword. It swept down in a blur; the sharp edge cut through flesh and bone, killing her scream before it could form. The creatures head rolled from its body. Henry looked around. He was back in the burial chamber.
	"It's over," he said, "finally over." He slumped down against a wall, exhausted. He thought about all he had accomplished today, but there was still work to be done. The last thing he wanted to do was spend more time in this forsaken tunnel. 
	He sat there for a while, looking at the wealth spread out before him. "Maybe the College won't notice just one missing jewel."
