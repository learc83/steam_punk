	"Get a beam over here now!" shouted Mr. Donald. "We're gonna be burried down here if we can't shore up this tunnel." Two men rushed over carrying a large wooden beam between them. They struggled to get the rough wood upright and wedged into place to support the roof.
	"Step back," Mr. Donald growled as he lifted a heavy wooden mallet like a toy. The big man reared back and with one swing knocked the support beam into place. The ceiling stopped shaking. "That's better," he said. "Now get that damn pony under control before she kicks over any more of the supports." The man responsible for the animal looked horrified, but managed to settle her as they walked back towards the surface.
	Henry Donald was a tall man, a few inches over six feet, well muscled with just a bit around his middle beginning to sag with age. His nose was slightly off where it had been broken and improperly set, and his short brown hair was starting to show streaks of gray. He had the scars to prove he'd been digging sewer tunnels most of his life, so the other men respected him and would've listened to him even if the Capital City Gas Light Company hadn't put him in charge.
	"Hey boss. Over here!" Luke, his number two, motioned him over. "From the sudden air movement after all that commotion, I'd say we just broke through to the catacombs."
	"Better send up for the steam hammer then, Luke. I'm not sure if the old passage on the other side is stable enough to blast our way in. Don't want to risk a collapse that could end the whole deal."
	"Right away boss...And boss?"
	"Yeah Luke?"
	"I know today's important to you. If you want to head out early, I'll stay down here till we finish opening up the catacombs."
	Henry thought about it for a second. "Thank you Luke. I think I will head home. Lucy's gonna be real happy. I'll tell her you said hello."
	As Henry moved up the sloped entrance to the sewer tunnel, he was struck by how much colder it was up here on the surface with the wind blowing. The sun was beginning to set and the shadow he cast walking up the ramp was twice as tall as he was. He walked over to the temporary wooden shack they'd built only last month, opened the flimsy door and went in. 
	Inside, the shack was divided into sections by thin wooden partitions. He peeled off his stinking work coveralls, encased in grime from the sewers, and moved behind one of the partitions. Henry pulled on a chain hanging from the celling and water fell from a tank on the roof. After a few seconds under the cold water, he dried off and pulled on his street clothes.
	The stench of the sewers never fully washed off, but Henry hoped he was reasonably clean and free from the smell of the city's waste as he left the work site and began the half mile walk home. Passing through the dimly lit side streets he imaged how the city would change when his project was complete. Hopefully the warm glow of gas lamps would make the rougher areas, like the one he lived in, much safer at night. Perhaps it would even attract new businesses. The important sections of town, the business district, the city center, and some of the wealthier residential neighborhoods, were already lit by bright blue glow crystals enchanted by the College of Magic. But glow crystals were too expensive to cover the entire city. Gas lightning was much cheaper, and though it angered the cities magicians to no end, the city council finally commissioned the newly formed Capital City Gas Light to lay gas lines through the sewers.
	Henry walked up to the front door of his home, a small two bedroom brick building connected to of a long line of identical row houses. Looking at his neighbor's broken window, he thought about how happy Lucy would be when he could finally afford move into a nicer middle class neighborhood. When the company hired him to build the tunnel connecting the gas pumping station to the main sewer line, he received a small share of stock as part of his payment. Once the project was complete he'd have enough money to retire and live in modest comfort, no more back breaking labor and long hours. With an early retirment so close he should have been in good spirits, but this day was always bittersweat.
	Before he could reach the knob, Lucy swung the door open. "Daddy!" she squealed as she threw her arms around him. "You're home early." Henry lifted his daughter into the air without a hint of effort and planted a kiss on her cheek.
	"I could smell your cooking all the way down in the tunnels, and I told the boys we had to stop work right then so I could get home before every hungry tramp in the city came knocking at the door." 
	"Daddy stop!" Lucy complained. "The Queen of the Fae herself couldn't make you shut down that site."
	"You got me there darling. Luke volunteered to stay late, so I could suprise you."
	"That was nice of him," she said as she took her fathers coat and hat. "Have a seat Daddy. I'll bring out some soup while we wait for the roast."
	Henry stared at the small table in the middle of the dining room. The setting looked inviting, the silverware and glass reflecting the dancing firelight, but the warm glow wasn't enough to stave off the sadness he felt at the sight of all the empty chairs. He wished there were six or seven places set around the table, instead of only two. 
	 As Lucy walked in carrying a steaming pot of soup, his stomach growled, snapping him out of his thoughts. Henry looked up and couldn't help but smile at how much Lucy looked like her mother. 14 years ago today he lost his wife, but it was also the anniversary of his daughter's birth, so Henry Donald resolved to enjoy the rest of the evening with the most pleasant company he could imagine.
	The next morning Henry was feeling better than he had in a while. His job was almost complete and his dream of a better life for his daughter within his grasp. He pulled on his coat and made his way to the job site. When he got to the site, Luke was there waiting for him.
	"What's wrong Luke, you look worried?
	"Boss, we lost Michael Collins in the catacombs last night."
	"What do you mean lost?" Henry asked.
	"Well we started working with the steam hammer. We managed to dig a small opening, but after a bit the machine just seazed up and the enigneer couldn't get it working again. Mike was the smallest guy here and he thought he could squeeze through to see if the other side was stable enough for blasting. After he went in, he said he heard something and was going deeper to check it out. 
	"Why the hell did you let him do that?" Henry yelled.
	"I told him not to but, I couldn't stop him," Luke said. "I waited for about an hour and tried to send in a man after him, but no one was small enough to fit." We've been trying to dig out a bigger opening all night, but without the steam hammer it'll take a while. He must be out of earshot because he hasn't responded to our calls."
	"Luke, why didn't you send someone to get me?" Henry asked.
	"I didn't want ruin Lucy's birthday, and besides, I didn't think there was anything you could try that I wasn't already doing. Boss there isn't another steam hammer in the city, and the one we have is going to take at least a week to fix."
	"Dammit! I knew using the catacombs as a shortcut for the tunnel was gonna cause problems" Henry said. "The company thought it would save time, but I knew something would go wrong." He looked Luke straight in the eye. "If you learn one thing from me Luke, remember this; cutting corners always, and I mean always, bites you in the ass."
	"What are we gonna do then boss?" Luke asked. "I'm all out of ideas."
	Henry stood there thinking for a moment, trying his best to project confidence and ignoring the biting wind whipping down the street.  "We're gonna blast our way in."
	"I thought you didn't want to risk blasting?" Luke asked.
	"Given the choices it's the best option. We can wait a week for the steam hammer, or keep digging by hand, but either way Mike would probably be dead before we found him. Every minute he's lost down there he'll probably wander farther and farther into the catacombs." 
	Henry entered the little shack and motioned for Luke to follow. "Run down to the tunnel and get the explosives ready to go," he growled, as he grabbed a pair of coveralls and stepped into a changing area. Leaning out from behind the partition Henry added, "I want those charges set by the time I get down there."
	"OK boss. I'll get on it," Luke said. He ran off to carry out his orders. Though he still looked tired, the worry was gone from his face. Henry knew that confidence inspired confidence. Years in the sewers and a stint in the army had taught him that. He didn't like the idea of potentially brining down the whole tunnel, but since he was sure this was the best choice he wasn't going to show any hesitation. He finished changing and marched out of the shack and down the ramp into the tunnel. 
	By the time he got there, the demolition team already had the small hole to the catacombs packed with explosives. Henry checked to make sure everything was in place then rounded up everyone and headed for the entrance. Once they were up top and ready the blow the explosives, Luke spoke up. "Boss, a few of the men said they heard someone screaming from inside the catacombs a few hours ago. At first I thought it might be Mike, but they said it sounded like a woman."
	"You know how easy miners startle. It was probably just the wind," Henry said. 
	"Maybe your right," Luke agreed. "Still kinda spooky though."
	"Only one way to find out for sure." Henry gave a forced laugh and grabbed the detonator. "Everyone clear we're gonna blow this in 5...4...3...2...1." He pushed the plunger down and a split second later an explosion, still loud even through covered ears, forced a huge cloud of dust up out of the entrance. 
	Henry and his men waited for the dust to clear then they went back down to survey the damage. "Looks like everything's holding up so far," Henry said when he got near the opening to the catacomb. A jagged gash almost the width and height of a man stood were the little hole had been. Henry was surprised by how small the opening was, the rock was much tougher than it should have been, but at least it was big enough to squeeze through standing up. "Luke, grab a lantern and come with me," he said. "The rest of you start checking the supports for damage."
	The two men squeezed through the opening into the unknown. Catacombs stretched through the city, but as far as anyone knew no one had explored this particular section for centuries. In fact no one even knew it existed until one of the company's engineers stumbled upon an obscure map in the city records. The company decided to use it as a shortcut for the gas lines, and if everything went according to plan it could shave months off of the total project time. So far, Henry thought, everything was not going according to plan. 
	When Henry finally pushed through he was standing in an arch shaped tunnel that stretched off in either direction. He noticed the walls first. They were unnaturally smooth, and completely clean. The blast should have coated every surface with a fine layer of dust, but it was as if a static charge was repelling the dirt. When he thought about it, the walls even felt charged. Henry held his hand against the smooth cold rock and closed his eyes; he could almost hear a faint hum. "Magic," he whispered. "This tunnel was carved with magic."
	"I've never seen anything like this before," Luke said. "None of the other catacombs in the city were carved out by magic."
	Henry opened up his lantern and looked down the tunnel. Nothing, but perfectly carved walls as far as he could see, but the floor seemed to slope gently downward in one direction.  "That's probably because there aren't many magicians around with the power to move this much rock." He laughed, "If there were we'd be out of a job."
	"Which way do you think Mike went, boss?" Luke asked.
	"Well, he was young and curious so I'm betting he set off that way," he said pointing in the direction of the downward slope. "Farther down and most likely to lead to trouble." Henry bent down and found a small stone next to the gash made from the blast. He reached back and threw it down the tunnel, listening to the echo as it bounced and rolled down the slope. He waited for the sound to stop, but it just faded away as it tumbled farther. When he could no longer hear the echo, he told Luke, "Well we better get going. Looks like tunnel goes down a ways." They started walking but as soon as they got going, Henry stopped. "Did you hear that?" he asked?
	"Yeah boss, and I don't think it was wind."
	"It almost sounded like someone calling my name," Henry added.
	"I thought it sounded like she was calling me," Luke said shivering a bit. "Maybe it was Mike yelling, and some kinda trick echo?"
	"Whatever it was, it came from down there," he said pointing in the direction they had been going, "so let's pick up the pace." They moved quickly down the slope until, a after a few hundred yards, they saw a room carved into the side of the tunnel. The room was a perfect circle, and in the middle, dominating the room, a bleached white skeleton rested on a solid stone platform. His hands were across his chest clutching a large jeweled scepter. Arrayed around the room, in alcoves carved into the wall, other skeltons were layed out in a similar manner.
	Henry entered the room first. He'd seen other gravesites in the catacombs throughout the city, but he was shocked by how old these remains must have been and the open display of weatlh. Surely people knew of this tomb in the time it was constructed. What had protected these jewels from looters over the centuries? Speechless, Henry walked around to the other side of the stone platform surveying the room. Suddenly his eyes were drawn to the floor next to the platform. It was Michael Collins. Laying on back, his head resting in a half congeled pool of blood. Henry shined his lantern on his face, it was frozen in terror.  Henry's heart pounded as he took in what he saw. He wasn't particulary close to Mike, but he was still one of his men. He might still be alive if Henry hadn't left early.
	"Luke, it's Mike!" Henry yelled. "Looks like he hit his head. From the look on his face, something must have startled him pretty good."
