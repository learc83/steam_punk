	"Get a beam over here now!" shouted Mr. Donald. "We're gonna be buried down here if we can't shore up this tunnel." Two men rushed over carrying a large wooden beam between them. They struggled to get the rough wood upright and wedged into place to support the roof.
	"Step back," Mr. Donald growled as he lifted a heavy wooden mallet like a toy. The big man reared back and with one swing knocked the support beam into place. The ceiling stopped shaking. "That's better," he said. "Now get that damn pony under control before she kicks over any more of the supports." The man responsible for the animal looked horrified, but managed to settle her as they walked back towards the surface.
	Henry Donald was a tall man, a few inches over six feet, well muscled with just a bit around his middle beginning to sag with age. His nose was slightly off where it had been broken and improperly set, and his short brown hair was starting to show streaks of gray. He had the scars to prove he'd been digging sewer tunnels most of his life, so the other men respected him and would've listened to him even if the Capital City Gas Light Company hadn't put him in charge.
	"Hey boss. Over here!" Luke, his number two, motioned him over. "From the sudden air movement after all that commotion, I'd say we just broke through to the catacombs."
	"Better send up for the steam hammer then, Luke. I'm not sure if the old passage on the other side is stable enough to blast our way in. Don't want to risk a collapse that could end the whole deal."
	"Right away boss...And boss?"
	"Yeah Luke?"
	"I know today's important to you. If you want to head out early, I'll stay down here till we finish opening up the catacombs."
	Henry thought about it for a second. "Thank you Luke. I think I will head home. Lucy's gonna be real happy. I'll tell her you said hello."
	As Henry moved up the sloped entrance to the sewer tunnel, he was struck by how much colder it was up here on the surface with the wind blowing. The sun was beginning to set and the shadow he cast walking up the ramp was twice as tall as he was. He walked over to the temporary wooden shack they'd built only last month, opened the flimsy door and went in. 
	Inside, the shack was divided into sections by thin wooden partitions. He peeled off his stinking work coveralls, encased in grime from the sewers, and moved behind one of the partitions. Henry pulled on a chain hanging from the celling and water fell from a tank on the roof. After a few seconds under the cold water, he dried off and pulled on his street clothes.
	The stench of the sewers never fully washed off, but Henry hoped he was reasonably clean and free from the smell of the city's waste as he left the work site and began the half mile walk home. Passing through the dimly lit side streets he imaged how the city would change when his project was complete. Hopefully the warm glow of gas lamps would make the rougher areas, like the one he lived in, much safer at night. Perhaps it would even attract new businesses. The important sections of town, the business district, the city center, and some of the wealthier residential neighborhoods, were already lit by bright blue glow crystals enchanted by the College of Magic. But glow crystals were too expensive to cover the entire city. Gas lightning was much cheaper, and though it angered the cities magicians to no end, the city council finally commissioned the newly formed Capital City Gas Light to lay gas lines through the sewers.
	Henry walked up to the front door of his home, a small two bedroom brick building connected to of a long line of identical row houses. Looking at his neighbor's broken window, he thought about how happy Lucy would be when he could finally afford move into a nicer middle class neighborhood. When the company hired him to build the tunnel connecting the gas pumping station to the main sewer line, he received a small share of stock as part of his payment. Once the project was complete he'd have enough money to retire and live in modest comfort, no more back breaking labor and long hours. With an early retirement so close he should have been in good spirits, but this day was always bittersweet.
	Before he could reach the knob, Lucy swung the door open. "Daddy!" she squealed as she threw her arms around him. "You're home early." Henry lifted his daughter into the air without a hint of effort and planted a kiss on her cheek.
	"I could smell your cooking all the way down in the tunnels, and I told the boys we had to stop work right then so I could get home before every hungry tramp in the city came knocking at the door." 
	"Daddy stop!" Lucy complained. "The Queen of the Fae herself couldn't make you shut down that site."
	"You got me there darling. Luke volunteered to stay late, so I could surprise you."
	"That was nice of him," she said as she took her fathers coat and hat. "Have a seat Daddy. I'll bring out some soup while we wait for the roast."
	Henry stared at the small table in the middle of the dining room. The setting looked inviting, the silverware and glass reflecting the dancing firelight, but the warm glow wasn't enough to stave off the sadness he felt at the sight of all the empty chairs. He wished there were six or seven places set around the table, instead of only two. 
	 As Lucy walked in carrying a steaming pot of soup, his stomach growled, snapping him out of his thoughts. Henry looked up and couldn't help but smile at how much Lucy looked like her mother. 14 years ago today he lost his wife, but it was also the anniversary of his daughter's birth, so Henry Donald resolved to enjoy the rest of the evening with the most pleasant company he could imagine.
	The next morning Henry was feeling better than he had in a while. His job was almost complete and his dream of a better life for his daughter within his grasp. He pulled on his coat and made his way to the job site. When he got to the site, Luke was there waiting for him.
	"What's wrong Luke, you look worried?
	"Boss, we lost Michael Collins in the catacombs last night."
	"What do you mean lost?" Henry asked.
	"Well we started working with the steam hammer. We managed to dig a small opening, but after a bit the machine just seized up and the engineer couldn't get it working again. Mike was the smallest guy here and he thought he could squeeze through to see if the other side was stable enough for blasting. After he went in, he said he heard something and was going deeper to check it out. 
	"Why the hell did you let him do that?" Henry yelled.
	"I told him not to but, I couldn't stop him," Luke said. "I waited for about an hour and tried to send in a man after him, but no one was small enough to fit." We've been trying to dig out a bigger opening all night, but without the steam hammer it'll take a while. He must be out of earshot because he hasn't responded to our calls."
	"Luke, why didn't you send someone to get me?" Henry asked.
	"I didn't want ruin Lucy's birthday, and besides, I didn't think there was anything you could try that I wasn't already doing. Boss there isn't another steam hammer in the city, and the one we have is going to take at least a week to fix."
	"Dammit! I knew using the catacombs as a shortcut for the tunnel was gonna cause problems" Henry said. "The company thought it would save time, but I knew something would go wrong." He looked Luke straight in the eye. "If you learn one thing from me Luke, remember this; cutting corners always, and I mean always, bites you in the ass."
	"What are we gonna do then boss?" Luke asked. "I'm all out of ideas."
	Henry stood there thinking for a moment, trying his best to project confidence and ignoring the biting wind whipping down the street.  "We're gonna blast our way in."
	"I thought you didn't want to risk blasting?" Luke asked.
	"Given the choices it's the best option. We can wait a week for the steam hammer, or keep digging by hand, but either way Mike would probably be dead before we found him. Every minute he's lost down there he'll probably wander farther and farther into the catacombs." 
	Henry entered the little shack and motioned for Luke to follow. "Run down to the tunnel and get the explosives ready to go," he growled, as he grabbed a pair of coveralls and stepped into a changing area. Leaning out from behind the partition Henry added, "I want those charges set by the time I get down there."
	"OK boss. I'll get on it," Luke said. He ran off to carry out his orders. Though he still looked tired, the worry was gone from his face. Henry knew that confidence inspired confidence. Years in the sewers and a stint in the army had taught him that. He didn't like the idea of potentially brining down the whole tunnel, but since he was sure this was the best choice he wasn't going to show any hesitation. He finished changing and marched out of the shack and down the ramp into the tunnel. 
	By the time he got there, the demolition team already had the small hole to the catacombs packed with explosives. Henry checked to make sure everything was in place then rounded up everyone and headed for the entrance. Once they were up top and ready the blow the explosives, Luke spoke up. "Boss, a few of the men said they heard someone screaming from inside the catacombs a few hours ago. At first I thought it might be Mike, but they said it sounded like a woman."
	"You know how easy miners startle. It was probably just the wind," Henry said. 
	"Maybe your right," Luke agreed. "Still kinda spooky though."
	"Only one way to find out for sure." Henry gave a forced laugh and grabbed the detonator. "Everyone clear we're gonna blow this in 5...4...3...2...1." He pushed the plunger down and a split second later an explosion, still loud even through covered ears, forced a huge cloud of dust up out of the entrance. 
	Henry and his men waited for the dust to clear then they went back down to survey the damage. "Looks like everything's holding up so far," Henry said when he got near the opening to the catacomb. A jagged gash almost the width and height of a man stood were the little hole had been. Henry was surprised by how small the opening was, the rock was much tougher than it should have been, but at least it was big enough to squeeze through standing up. "Luke, grab a lantern and come with me," he said. "The rest of you start checking the supports for damage."
	The two men squeezed through the opening into the unknown. Catacombs stretched through the city, but as far as anyone knew no one had explored this particular section for centuries. In fact no one even knew it existed until one of the company's engineers stumbled upon an obscure map in the city records. The company decided to use it as a shortcut for the gas lines, and if everything went according to plan it could shave months off of the total project time. So far, Henry thought, everything was not going according to plan. 
	When Henry finally pushed through he was standing in an arch shaped tunnel that stretched off in either direction. He noticed the walls first. They were unnaturally smooth, and completely clean. The blast should have coated every surface with a fine layer of dust, but it was as if a static charge was repelling the dirt. When he thought about it, the walls even felt charged. Henry held his hand against the smooth cold rock and closed his eyes; he could almost hear a faint hum. "Magic," he whispered. "This tunnel was carved with magic."
	"I've never seen anything like this before," Luke said. "None of the other catacombs in the city were carved out by magic."
	Henry opened up his lantern and looked down the tunnel. Nothing, but perfectly carved walls as far as he could see, but the floor seemed to slope gently downward in one direction.  "That's probably because there aren't many magicians around with the power to move this much rock." He laughed, "If there were we'd be out of a job."
	"Which way do you think Mike went, boss?" Luke asked.
	"Well, he was young and curious so I'm betting he set off that way," he said pointing in the direction of the downward slope. "Farther down and most likely to lead to trouble." Henry bent down and found a small stone next to the gash made from the blast. He reached back and threw it down the tunnel, listening to the echo as it bounced and rolled down the slope. He waited for the sound to stop, but it just faded away as it tumbled farther. When he could no longer hear the echo, he told Luke, "Well we better get going. Looks like tunnel goes down a ways." They started walking but as soon as they got going, Henry stopped. "Did you hear that?" he asked?
	"Yeah boss, and I don't think it was wind."
	"It almost sounded like someone calling my name," Henry added.
	"I thought it sounded like she was calling me," Luke said shivering a bit. "Maybe it was Mike yelling, and some kinda trick echo?"
	"Whatever it was, it came from down there," he said pointing in the direction they had been going, "so let's pick up the pace." They moved quickly down the slope until, a after a few hundred yards, they saw a room carved into the side of the tunnel. The room was a perfect circle, and in the middle, dominating the room, a bleached white skeleton rested on a solid stone platform. His hands laid across his chest clutching a gold scepter, a huge gleaming emerald set into the top, and thick gold bracelets wrapped around his wrists. Arrayed around the room, in alcoves carved into the wall, other skeletons were laid out in a similar manner. Each one wore a small fortune in stunning gemstones and ornate gold jewelry. 
	Henry entered the room first. He'd seen other tombs in the catacombs throughout the city, but he was shocked by how old these remains must have been and by the open display of wealth. Surely people knew of this tomb in the time it was constructed. What had protected this treasure from looters over the centuries? Speechless, Henry walked around to the other side of the stone platform surveying the room. Suddenly his eyes were drawn to the floor next to the platform. It was Michael Collins lying still on the ground. Henry shined the lantern on his face; it was frozen in terror.  His heart pounded as he took in what he saw. 
	"It's Mike!" Henry yelled. "He's dead, and from the look on his face, something must have startled him pretty good," He knelt down to investigate further. Luke quickly joined him, and they both looked over the body. 
	Luke spoke up first, "Boss, I don't have a clue what could've killed him."
	"Nothing I can see either," Henry added. He was perplexed, and the body troubled him. Not that he was particularly close to the boy, but he was responsible for him. Mike might even be alive if Henry hadn't left early the day before. At moments like this it was easy to just sit and sulk, but this wasn't new to him. He'd lost enough men to know beating himself up wouldn't do any good. He wasn't even sure why Mike was dead yet, so he forced himself to concentrate. Second guessing could come later. Right now he had to figure out what happened. 
	He noticed the boy had a small white comb in his right hand, made of some type of bone. "I wonder why he's holding onto this comb?" Henry added as he pried it from his fingers.
	"He didn't have a girl that I know of," said Luke.
	Henry examined the comb. "It's obviously a woman's comb, but from the look of it, I don't think it's the kind of thing a young girl would use," Henry said. "It's too old and beat up." 
	"You know, I think Mike lived with his grandmother. Maybe it belonged to her," Luke suggested.
	"Maybe, but I'm still not sure why he'd bring it down into the tunnels with him." Henry thought for a second then added, "I think I'll take the comb and go see his grandmother. If it is hers, she'll be happy to have it back. In any case I'll have to tell her about Mikes death, and I can ask her if she noticed anything wrong with him that could've caused this."
	"What do you want me to do boss? Luke asked"
	"While I try to figure this out, you work on widening the entrance, but don't let anyone into the catacombs."
 	"Can do," Luke agreed.
	The tenement building Mike's grandmother lived in was only a few blocks away from the job site. She was on the first floor of the brick building and had the small luxury of a private entrance way directly to the street. Before Henry even made it up the small staircase, the door swung open. An old woman was standing in the doorway, talking to a rather pregnant and rather young girl. When the girl noticed Henry she scurried down the steps, clutching a jar of sloshing black liquid. She kept her head lowered to the side to avoid looking at Henry and almost tripped at the bottom.
	"Careful young lady!" he said as he reached out steady her. "You don't want take a tumble in your condition." The old woman at the top of the stairs smirked at his comment, while the girl just mumbled her thanks and hurried off.
	"What are you doing here young man?" the old lady asked. Henry was hardly young, but the woman before him looked old enough to be Mike's great-grandmother. Her hair was held back in a scrawny bun, a few wisps struggling to escape, and her blue dress was out of fashion before Henry was born."You're scaring away my customers."
	Mike's friends had said the old woman dabbled in unlicensed magic, but he dismissed their stories as idle gossip. Maybe they were right. "Mrs. Collins?" Henry questioned.
	As she looked him over, he felt like a piece of fruit in the market stall. At least she hadn't tried to poke at him yet, he thought with a shudder. "Yes, I am Mrs. Collins. Who are you?"
	"I'm Mr. Donald, Michael's boss. I'm afraid I have some bad news." Henry had done this before, so he almost had a script. "Can I come inside?" He thought he saw a hint of worry on her otherwise stoney expression when she motioned him to follow her in.
	The decor in the small tenement was much nicer than Henry would have expected. The sitting room was neat and orderly, and was lit by the eerie blue light of expensive glow crystals mixed with the afternoon sun. It appeared Mrs. Collins must have made quite a bit of extra money on the side. 
	She motioned for him to sit down on the sofa while she placed a cup of steaming tea on the low table in front of him. Henry had second thoughts about drinking it, but when she poured herself a cup, sitting in a high backed chair across from him, he took a sip.	
	"Mrs. Collins," he said after putting down his tea. "I'm sorry to tell you this, but Michael has passed away. We found him in the catacombs earlier today. We had just broken through, and he went in to scout it out. I apologize for your loss."
	Her shoulders slumped, and she turned her head for a moment. When she looked back at him, her eyes had gone completely cold. She sat there just staring at Henry. The lack of emotion turned his blood as icy as her eyes, but when she spoke up, she couldn't keep the anger from her voice. "Your apologies aren't going to help my grandson. I told that boy not to go digging around in the crypts. He said the money was too good, but I was afraid something might happen down there." Henry thought he saw her hand tremble slightly as she took a sip of tea. "Tell me Mr. Donald, how did he die?" she asked.
	"There wasn't a mark on his body. I was hoping to ask about his health, and about this." He took the comb from his pocket. It was bone white and from the looks, very old. It was covered with scratches and so well used that the teeth were noticeably worn down.
	Mrs. Collins eyes flew to the comb. "Where did you find that?" she asked.
	"He was holding it when we found him."
	"Michael told me that you were about to tunnel into an unknown section of the catacombs. Did you find any graves?" Mrs. Collins inquired.
	"Yes we did. I think they were very old." Henry replied.
	"And has anyone heard a woman's voice calling to them?"
	"Yes...I did. And some of my employees said they heard a woman screaming from inside the catacombs."
	Mrs. Collins looked at Henry. He saw her mask melt away as her face filled with genuine concern. She leaned forward and said, "Mr. Donald. My grandson didn't have any health problems. He was murdered. 
	"Why do you say that?" 
	Mrs. Collins pointed to the comb. "Because that certainly belonged to a Baen Sidhe. Look at how old it is." Henry instinctively dropped the comb on the table. "It's said a Baen Sidhe spends most of her time combing her tangled hair, trying in vain to look beautiful again. The quickest way anger one is to taker her comb. The stories also say a Baen Sidhe always calls her victims by name."
	Henry wasn't a superstitious man, but the look on Michael's face was etched in his mind, and how could she know about the voice he heard calling his name. He listened as she went on. "It's just like you learned as a school boy. Centuries ago, the land was ruled by powerful families of magicians. Then the people overthrew them and the College of Magic was established."
	"What do old history lessons have to do with this?" he asked.
	"Listen young man." Mrs. Collins snarled. "Do you want to learn what I know about my grandson's murderer or not?" Henry stayed quiet and she continued. "That's better. The magical families revered their ancestors immensely. So when they realized they were close to defeat, they found a way to protect their ancestral tombs even after they were gone."
	"Some kind of curse?" Henry interrupted.
 	"Not exactly," she replied. "The magicians needed an eternal protector, and they knew that the fae folk live indefinitely. So They developed magic that could bind one of the fae to a tomb forever. Eventually, it grows tired of living locked up in a tomb, but because it's magically bound it can't end it's existence. As it loses its mind, it loses its beauty and warps into a twisted Baen Sidhe. It becomes the guardian of the tomb the magicians desired; its only desire to kill."
	Henry didn't like the sound of that. "But how could it kill without leaving a scratch?"
	"The fae folk have the power of illusion. This power only grows as the Baen Sidhe ages, until it can damage the mind by appearing to harm the body," she answered.
	"So it can make someone believe they have been injured, without physically harming them?"
	"Correct, young man."
	Henry wondered where the old woman had learned all this, but she seemed sincere. If the Baen Sidhe was real, he needed to know one thing. "How can you kill it?" he said with as much resolve as he could muster.
	"The easiest ways is to severe it's head with cold steel," she said "It isn't a spirit, so that should do it." "The hard part is getting it to stay still while you do the removing." Mrs. Collins stopped and thought for a while. "The fae hate salt. Maybe you could get it to eat something salty. That might slow it down." She couldn't be serious, he thought.
	"How am I supposed to get it to do that?"
	"I haven't the foggiest." She looked straight at Henry, and the steel returned to her eyes.  "But Mr. Donald, if you do manage to kill the beast, promise me you'll bring back a token."
	Henry nodded as he got up to walk out. He had a lot to think about. 
	He walked the street looking tired and defeated. This had been one of the worst days of his life. The old woman's explanation sounded absurd, losing a man to the guardian of an ancient tomb, but he believed it. Her story fit the evidence too well not to. What could he do about it though? Henry Donald wasn't a man to give up, but he dug tunnels. He didn't kill monsters.
