	"Get a beam over here now!" shouted Mr. Donald. "We're gonna be burried down here if we can't shore up this tunnel." Two men rushed over carrying a large wooden beam between them. They struggled to get the rough wood upright and wedged into place to support the roof.
	"Step back," Mr. Donald growled as he lifted a heavy wooden mallet like a toy. The big man reared back and with one swing knocked the support beam into place. The ceiling stopped shaking. "That's better," he said. "Now get that damn pony under control before she kicks over any more of the supports." The man responsible for the animal looked horrified, but managed to settle her as they walked back towards the surface.
	Henry Donald was a tall man, a few inches over six feet, well muscled with just a bit around his middle beginning to sag with age. His nose was slightly off where it had been broken and improperly set, and his short brown hair was starting to show streaks of gray. He had the scars to prove he'd been digging sewer tunnels all his life, so the other men respected him and would've listened to him even if the Capital City Gas Light Company hadn't put him in charge.
	"Hey boss. Over here!" Luke, his number two, motioned him over. "From the sudden air movement after all that commotion, I'd say we just broke through to the catacombs."
	"Better send up for the steam hammer then, Luke. I'm not sure if the old passage on the other side is stable enough to blast our way in. Don't want to risk a collapse that could end the whole deal."
	"Right away boss...And boss?"
	"Yeah Luke?"
	"I know today's important to you. If you want to head out early, I'll stay down here till we finish opening up the catacombs."
	Henry thought about it for a second. "Thank you Luke. I think I will head home. Lucy's gonna be real happy. I'll tell her you said hello."
	As Henry moved up the sloped entrance to the sewer tunnel, he was struck by how much colder it was up here on the surface with the wind blowing. The sun was beginning to set and the shadow he cast walking up the ramp was twice as tall as he was. He walked over to the temporary wooden shack they'd built only last month, opened the flimsy door and went in. 
	Inside, the shack was divided into sections by thin wooden partitions. He peeled off his stinking work coveralls, encased in grime from the sewers, and moved behind one of the partitions. Henry pulled on a chain hanging from the celling and water fell from a tank on the roof. After a few seconds under the cold water, he dried off and pulled on his street clothes.
	The stench of the sewers never fully washed off, but Henry hoped he was reasonably clean and free from the smell of the city's waste as he left the work site and began the half mile walk home. Passing through the dimly lit side streets he imaged how the city would change when his project was complete. Hopefully the warm glow of gas lamps would make the rougher areas, like the one he lived in, much safer at night. Perhaps it would even attract new businesses. The important sections of town, the business district, the city center, and some of the wealthier residential neighborhoods, were already lit by bright blue glow crystals enchanted by the College of Magic. But glow crystals were too expensive to cover the entire city. Gas lightning was much cheaper, and though it angered the cities magicians to no end, the city council finally commissioned the newly formed Capital City Gas Light to lay gas lines through the sewers.
	Henry walked up to the front door of his home, a small two bedroom brick building connected to of a long line of identical row houses. Looking at his neighbor's broken window, he thought about how happy Lucy would be when he could finally afford move into a nicer middle class neighborhood. When the company hired him to build the tunnel connecting the gas pumping station to the main sewer line, he received a small share of stock as part of his payment. Once the project was complete he'd have enough money to retire and live in modest comfort, no more back breaking labor and long hours. With an early retirment so close he should have been in good spirits, but this day was always bittersweat.
	Before he could reach the knob, Lucy swung the door open. "Daddy!" she squealed as she threw her arms around him. "You're home early." Henry lifted his daughter into the air without a hint of effort and planted a kiss on her cheek.
	"I could smell your cooking all the way down in the tunnels, and I told the boys we had to stop work right then so I could get home before every hungry tramp in the city came knocking at the door." 
	"Daddy stop!" Lucy complained. "The Queen of the Fae herself couldn't make you shut down that site."
	"You got me there darling. Luke volunteered to stay late, so I could suprise you."
	"That was nice of him," she said as she took her fathers coat and hat. "Have a seat Daddy. I'll bring out some soup while we wait for the roast."
	Henry stared at the small table in the middle of the dining room. The setting looked inviting, the silverware and glass reflecting the dancing firelight, but the warm glow wasn't enough to stave off the sadness he felt at the sight of all the empty chairs. He wished there were six or seven places set around the table, instead of only two. 
	 As Lucy walked in carrying a steaming pot of soup, his stomach growled, snapping him out of his thoughts. Henry looked up and couldn't help but smile at how much Lucy looked like her mother. 14 years ago today he lost his wife, but it was also the anniversary of his daughter's birth, so Henry Donald resolved to enjoy the rest of the evening with the most pleasant company he could imagine.
	The next morning Henry was feeling better than he had in a while. His job was almost complete and his dream of a better life for his daughter within his grasp. He pulled on his coat and made his way to the job site. When he got to the site, Luke was there waiting for him.
	"What's wrong Luke, you look worried?
	"Boss, we lost Michael Collins in the catacombs last night."
	"What do you mean lost?" Henry asked.
	"Well we started working with the steam hammer. We managed to dig a small opening, but after a bit the steam hammer just seazed up and the enigneer couldn't get it working again. Mike was the smallest guy here and he thought he could squeeze through to see if the other side was stable enough for blasting. After he went in, he said he heard something and was going deeper to check it out. 
	"Why the hell did you let him do that?" Henry yelled.
	"I told him not to but, I couldn't stop him," Luke said. "I waited for about an hour and tried to send in a man after him, but no one was small enough to fit." We've been trying to dig out a bigger opening all night, but without the steam hammer it'll take a while."
	"Luke, why didn't you send someone to get me?" Henry asked.
	"I didn't want ruin Lucy's birthday, and besides, I didn't think there was anything else you could try that I wasn't already doing. Boss there isn't another steam hammer in the city, and the one we have is going to take at least a week to fix."
	"Dammit! I knew using the catacombs as a shortcut for the tunnel was gonna cause problems" Henry said. "The Company thought it would save time, but I knew something would go wrong." He looked Luke straight in the eye. "If you learn one thing from me Luke, cutting corners always, and I mean always, bites you in the ass."
	"What are we gonna do then boss?" Luke asked. "I'm all out of ideas."
	Henry stood there thinking for a moment, trying his best to project confidence and ignoring the biting wind whipping down the street.  "We're gonna blast our way in."
