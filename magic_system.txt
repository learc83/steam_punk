Magic System

- Redirection - Absorb and redirect energy: lower ambient temperature to produce a heat blast, or absorb sound and produce piercing screech.
	Natural talent determines range and extent of absorption.  Average magician has can absorb within a dozen feet or so. Skill determines how accurate they are. Unskilled magician would be able to absorb all in a sphere around him, while a skilled magician could just take the heat from a fireplace across the room. The more energy present the easier and faster it is: it's much faster to suck enough heat out of a roaring fire to make a fire-blast than it is to get the same amount of energy from a person's body.
	The less energy there is the more tiring this becomes and the longer it takes, so the magicians have pre-charged crystals filled with different kinds of energy: heat, sound, electricity etc... It is much faster to draw energy from the crystals than from the environment, because the energy density and intensity is very high: lots of energy squeezed into a tiny crystal.
	Need to explore technology's impact on this: merchants who make a steam powered electrical generator to power up crystals and undercut The College of Magic. Also maybe there are some magicians who cary around generators and the like to draw power from.

- Mind Magic - Influence thoughts and feelings: make people think you look different (effectively shape-shift), nudge someone's emotions to produce feelings.
	Innate ability that the Fae and people with fae blood possess. You can make them like you a little more, or make someone more afraid, but only to a certain extent. You can't make someone who hates your guts love you or a brave soldier cower in terror for no reason, but you could push them in the right direction.

- Alter Natural Laws - Change the laws of physics: gravity no longer effects a book so it can float around, lower the melting point of  a steel door, so it liquifies at room temperature.
	Not sure about the limits of this yet. The more spectacular it is the longer it takes and can be very tiring. Toying with requiring opposite reactions. Like reducing gravity on one object by enhancing it on another. Also constant use of this magic by magicians is messing up the laws of physics and causing all kinds of problems.
