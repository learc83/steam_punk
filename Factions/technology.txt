TECHNOLOGY

	The technological revolution began hundreds of years ago when alchemists from the College of Magic stumbled upon gunpowder. They viewed it as a curiosity for decades but nothing more. Eventually a young magic student eager to make some extra gold sold the recipe to a merchant. Over time people developed new uses and eventually made guns. 
	The College of Magic hated guns b/c they believed they allowed those not skilled in magic to wield power that should be reserved for them. The College tried to convince the King to ban guns outright but they proved to useful in combat. They settled for banning any member of the College from enchanting gunpowder weaponry.
	About 50 years before the story takes place, the steam engine was developed and the resulting technological advancements were not looked on any more favorably than gunpowder by the College of Magic. The College banned any Mage from having anything to do with technology and tried their best to halt its progress, but technology was just too useful and its use spread.
	Now at the time of the story, there are trains spread throughout the kingdom and Doctors are beginning to develop medicines and techniques to combat diseases previously only curable by magic. The church supports the advancement of knowledge and technology mainly because of this. Only the wealthy could afford access to magical cures previously.
