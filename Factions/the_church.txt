THE CHURCH
	The Church supports the advancement of technology because they believe it will help advance improve people's lives. The Church is monotheistic. Worships their universe's version of God who I haven't named yet.
	 The Church is still fairly influential with the masses, but it lacks real secular power. The head of the church use to wield power over kings, but with the rise of magic centuries ago their power waned.
