COLLEGE OF MAGIC

	The College of Magic is an organization that includes all legitimate magic users in the realm. The College is ruled by a council of mages who control all things magical. Originally formed centuries ago to regulate dangerous magic they are forbidden from inheriting or buying titles and land. By preventing them from owning land the King (centuries ago) who created the College intended to keep them out of politics and power struggles. However since they control all legitimate magic users they are the only ones the wealthy can turn to for magical services (and only the wealthy can afford their services).
	They offer many magical services, one of the most lucrative is enchanting swords and armor for the nobility, allowing knights to wade into combat shrugging off bullets (enchantments this powerful however require a lot of time and energy and are VERY expensive this is why nobles are eager to have Magic users in the family even though it prevents them from inheriting titles or land).
	Any use of magic not sanctioned by the College of Magic is illegal. There are numerous hedge wizards and healers operating outside the College of Magic however,  and at various times in history are either overlooked or are persecuted depending on the whims of the current king and the College.
