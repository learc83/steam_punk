ENCHANTMENT

	For Mages to enchant an item to magically improve it, they must understand the principles of how it works. It is easy to understand a sword or armor, and the schools of magic take so long to complete because the student is learning to comprehend all of the spells and enchantments they perform. However the College of Magic has forbidden all members from studying technology. Thus even if there were not a ban on enchanting complex items the Mages from the College of Magic would lack the understanding to do so.
	Because merchants can not hire legitimate mages to enchant their modern devices they hire illegal hedge wizards to assist them. These merchants also sell enchanted items that have nothing to do with technology like swords or knives at much lower prices than it costs to hire a Mage to enchant.
