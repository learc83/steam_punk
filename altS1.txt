	Merry mopped his forehead and cursed silently under his breath. In summer the library was almost unbearable. The heat built up quickly inside the thick walls lined with layers of books, and moving the large heavy tomes from one shelf to another worked up quite a sweat. He glanced up at the sound of laughter from a group of students at the table directly across from him. Immediately self conscious, he smoothed his damp, fair hair, which currently resembled a bale of straw, hoping his face was not too flushed with heat. He sighed, relieved as he realized the students sitting nearby didn't appear to notice him. They didn't appear to notice the stifling heat either. Merry knew they were oblivious to the temperature because of the small crystals they wore tied around there necks, enchanted to make the air surrounding them cool and comfortable. Though he was quite capable, making a similar atmosphere charm for himself was against the rules for an unlicensed magician. He could buy one of course, like they had, but charms were expensive and he didn't have the money to waste. Merry was attending the School of Magic on a scholarship, granted because of his exceptional abilities. The award only paid for tuition and board, so every bit of money he earned from his work in the library went toward's books, clothing and other necessities.
	He supposed he should be grateful that he was even here at all, serving as an assistant to the librarian of the school of magic. Professor McQuillen was one of the most respected magicians in the world and possessed a vast amount of knowledge of the history of magic.  Merry knew he should be appreciative of the opportunity to even be near such a man but at the moment, all he could think about was how hard the librarian made him work.
