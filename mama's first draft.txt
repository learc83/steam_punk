	Merry mopped his forehead and cursed silently under his breath.  The library was hot and Merry had worked up quite a sweat moving large heavy stacks of books from one shelf to another.  He glanced up at the sound of laughter from a group of students at the table directly across from him.  Immediately self conscious, he smoothed his damp, fair hair, which at this moment resembled a bale of straw,  and hoped his face was not too flushed pink with heat.  He sighed, relieved as he realized the students in front of him appeared not to have noticed him.  They appeared not to notice the stifling heat in the library as well.  No doubt, they all possessed atmosphere charms that made the air around them cool and comfortable. The ingredients to make such charms were expensive, and Merry could not afford such as an extravagance. He could not afford to attend the School either. Merry knew that if it weren't for the scholarship he had earned six years ago when he had impressed the School of Magic with his unusual abilities, that he would never have been able to even enter the prestigious library of magic.  He supposed he should be grateful that he was even here at all, serving as an assistant to the librarian of the school of magic.   Professor McQuillen was one of the most respected wizards in the world and possessed a vast amount of knowledge of the history of magic.  Merry knew he should be appreciative of the opportunity to even be near such a man but at the moment, all he could think about was how hard the librarian made him work. 
	Glaring at the group of students gathered at the table not ten feet in front of him, Merry realized he was jealous.  And why shouldn't he be?  They seemed to have such an effortless existence, plenty of gold as well as a comfort charm for every occasion. Though they were forbidden from using magic for ordinary chores,  as was Merry, he knew that they had far fewer chores than he did.  And what chores they did complete were no doubt made much more comfortable by the expensive charms that their wealthy parents had provided them with.  Their parents, too could afford to send them large monthly allowances that they spent quickly every night at the expensive entertainment establishments that cropped up near the school to cater to the students.
	 Merry's family was far from wealthy.  Minor nobility and landowners though they were, the farm was far from prosperous and the drought this past summer ensured that  they were even worse off than before. Merry's hands slipped into the pocket of his coat and touched the small packet which contained the letter that he received from home just that morning. The small amount of pocket change his mother had been able to send him throughout his first five years at the College of Magic had been barely enough for him to get by. Merry's last year at the College would be a dire one indeed now that she could not even afford to send that precious small pittance. Surely, there was some way he could make things easier on himself, he was a talented magician after all, even if he had yet to graduate.  What would be the harm in using a little magic now and then?  Everyone else did, once in a while, even if it was forbidden, and wasn't the use of comfort charms enchanted by someone else  just as bad as using magic?  Merry certainly thought so. 
	"Hey you!", shouted a particularly tall student in the group before him. "Stop staring at us and make yourself useful Fetch us all of the books by Aldous Burnside." Now that the tall boy had drawn attention to him all of the students at the table were looking his way.  Merry's eyes narrowed.  Who did these students think they were?  Mere sophomores, by the looks of them, and certainly not the scholarly type.  Merry knew without a doubt his magic was far superior to any one of them, charms or not.  
	"That's not my job", he said and did not avert his eyes.  
	"What are they paying you for then?", asked another one of the group, a ruddy boy with eyes too close together and a slightly upturned nose. Merry recognized him. He was Simon Godard, the grandson of one of the council members that governed the College of Mages.  Merry turned his back, sighed deeply and tried to ignore him as he returned to work on the large stack of books.  Simon was not someone to pick a fight with.  But as he lifted his hand to take a large volume from the pile, the ruddy boy waved his hand and the stack of books Merry was working on flew off  the shelf and landed with a loud bang. 
	 Merry angrily turned to face his antagonizers, "You don't know who you're dealing with", he said, in a low voice, his mind involuntarily forming the beginnings of a malicious spell. Just before the words tumbled out of his mouth that would have likely put the whole group in the infirmary for a week, he regained control and clamped his mouth shut.  Merry knew that he would certainly be expelled if he injured Councilman Godard's grandson, so he turned to the books scattered on the floor, and with a flick of his wrist the stack rearranged itself and floated back to position on the shelf.  Simon laughed and raised his hand as if to strew Merry's work once more but hastily lowered it as he noticed Professor McQuillen looking in his direction.  
	Simon's ruddy face grew even redder, and his mouth froze in horror as Professor McQuillen hurried over to the table.  "What is this!" shouted the Professor.  "Godard!" he shouted, "You know full well that magic is against school policy."  He waved his hands dismissively.  "Out!  All of you!"   The group of sophomores hurriedly gathered up their books and quickly disappeared out the door, almost as if by magic.  
	"And you.." Professor McQuillen began, looking hard at Merry.  "What do you think you were doing? You used magic, too."
	"But-" sputtered Merry, "They-"
	"Yes, I know," said the Professor, not unkindly.  "You used magic to restore the work they ruined.  But still, Meriwether, you should have known better.  It's against the rules and besides, it will make you lazy.  Magicians must use magic wisely, never for petty reasons."
	"But was I to allow them to ruin all my hard hours of work?  That hardly seems fair!"  Merry's eyebrows rose and disappeared in the forelock of fair hair that hung above them.  
	"You could have asked them to pick up the mess they made.  With their hands, of course"  said Professor McQuillen, his eyes looking large and wise behind his spectacles.  "That would have been the proper response."  he added. 
	"Of course sir," Merry admitted, but his hands curled into fists inside the pockets of his coat and his fingernails dug marks into his palms .

	The envelope was labeled, "Meriwether ___"  and was wedged inside the doorframe to his small room.  He ripped into it, too curious to bother with being careful.  Inside the envelope were two small squares of paper.  One looked like an invitation of some sort, the other, clearly a map.  Merry flung himself onto his bed and began to read:
				Dear Mr. ____,
			 	 I am a small shopkeeper with need of an assistant.  I believe you may find this 	position to be financially rewarding.  Please meet with me at my clothier shop before dawn 	tomorrow and we will discuss my proposition.  For the courtesy of meeting with me, a gold piece 	will be provided.  
																							Sincerely,
										      Mr. William Denton

	Merry tossed the note onto his bed and turned his attention to the map.   What could this possibly be about?  Merry was skeptical, what would a clothier want with his assistance?  He had never heard of a William Denton and didn't know anything about clothing,  tailoring or shopkeeping.  Could the shopkeeper want his services for some kind of illegal magic?  He'd heard of hedge wizards before, low life magicians who performed magical services for money.  It was definitely a shady sort of business and poor or not, Merry did not want to become involved in something  that might get him expelled from school or worse.  His family had invested too much in his schooling.  He knew he should be at home, working the farm, helping his mother wi
th the difficult chores.  Since his father had died and he was the oldest son, it was his duty, but his mother had insisted.  She wouldn't hear of him staying at home, not when she knew he had so much talent.  And so, with his uncle's help, he'd procured a scholarship to the school of magic and here he was, the pinnacle of his family's hopes and dreams. 
	But still, Mr. Denton did promise a gold piece for his trouble and he could definitely use that gold piece.  He could hear the man out and if he were asked to do anything other than legitimate work, he could always refuse.  Besides, it might even turn out to be a legitimate job offer and he'd be foolish not to at least find out.  The shop seemed to be a small distance away.  Not too far, but if he were to be there before dawn, he'd have to wake up awfully early and the road would be dark. Was it really worth it  for the promise of a gold piece and a vague hope of a job?  Merry reached beside him for the note he had discarded.  His fingers found only a pile of dust.  He glanced at the map still in his hand, committing it to memory, then let it slide from his fingers.  A sprinkling of dust fell upon his chest.   It was an enchanted letter, made to disappear as soon as it was out of it's recipient's grasp.  Merry knew he would leave early the next morning, whether the stars were out to light his path or not, to seek out this Mr. Denton.  He was curious.

	The small clothing shop looked ordinary enough.  Merry knocked on the door and waited, listening to the crow of a rooster as dawn began to break in the sky.  The shop was dark and no one answered.  He half-hoped no one would.   After knocking several more times and hearing no sounds of stirring inside, he began to grow irritated.  He placed a hand upon the door knob  and to his amazement it opened.  The door swung silently into the shop and Merry was greeted by a rush of warmth and light and the fragrance of new cloth and something else, oil and machinery.   He entered the shop and listened, hearing nothing.  At last, he heard the sound of footsteps, seemingly coming from far away, and then closer.  A small grey man appeared. 
	 "Hello Meriwether" he said, pleasantly.  "I knew you'd come."  He clasped Merry's hand with both his own. "For your trouble, just as I promised."  He released Merry's hand, leaving a gold piece in his palm.  "I am Mr. Denton, and what brings you here?" 
	"What brings me here?  Why, you did, of course. I got your letter. "  Merry replied as his eyebrows drew together, nearly meeting in the middle. 
	"Ah yes, but besides that?  What brings you here?  Why did you come? "   Mr. Denton looked at him waiting for an answer.  
	"I need money," said Merry, "and I was curious. I wanted to know what a tailor could possibly want from me."
	"You can't find the answer because you're asking the wrong question. I am more than a mere tailor. Let me explain. If you'll come with me." Mr. Denton moved towards the back of his shop past racks of expensive looking clothing, and brushed aside a curtain guarding a small room. He motioned for Merry to go in first.
	The room was barely big enough to hold the upright glass display case and the two men now standing in it. Merry stared intently at the pocket watches on display as Mr. Denton pulled the doors of the case open. Of course Merry had seen a pocket watch before, but never so many in one place and never so finely crafted. Magical time pieces had been around for centuries, but were so expensive that only magicians and the very wealthy possessed them. Mechanical clocks were a far more recent invention and were difficult to manufacture. However, while they were out of reach of most of the kingdom's citizens, mechanical clocks could be produced without the aid and approval of the College of Mages allowing them to be sold for a fraction of the price of their magical cousins.
