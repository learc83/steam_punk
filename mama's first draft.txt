	Merry mopped his forehead and cursed silently under his breath.  The library was hot and Merry had worked up quite a sweat moving large heavy stacks of books from one shelf to another.  He glanced up at the sound of laughter from a group of students at the table directly across from him.  Immediately self conscious, he smoothed his damp, fair hair, which at this moment resembled a bale of straw,  and hoped his face was not too flushed pink with heat.  He sighed, relieved as he realized the students in front of him appeared not to have noticed him.  They appeared not to notice the stifling heat in the library as well.  No doubt, they all possessed atmosphere charms that made the air around them cool and comfortable. The ingredients to make such charms were expensive, and Merry could not afford such as an extravagance. He could not afford to attend the School either. Merry knew that if it weren't for the scholarship he had earned six years ago when he had impressed the School of Magic with his unusual abilities, that he would never have been able to even enter the prestigious library of magic.  He supposed he should be grateful that he was even here at all, serving as an assistant to the librarian of the school of magic.   Professor ? was one of the most respected wizards in the world and possessed a vast amount of knowledge of the history of magic.  Merry knew he should be appreciative of the opportunity to even be near such a man but at the moment, all he could think about was how hard the librarian made him work. 
	Glaring at the group of students gathered at the table not ten feet in front of him, Merry realized he was jealous.  And why shouldn't he be?  They seemed to have such an effortless existence, plenty of gold as well as a comfort charm for every occasion. Though they were forbidden from using magic for ordinary chores,  as was Merry, he knew that they had far fewer chores than he did.  And what chores they did complete were no doubt made much more comfortable by the expensive charms that their wealthy parents had provided them with.  Their parents, too could afford to send them large monthly allowances that they spent quickly every night at the expensive entertainment establishments that cropped up near the school to cater to the students.
	 Merry's parents were far from wealthy. And now that his father's business had been ? , they were even poorer than before.  Merry's hands slipped into the pocket of his robe and touched the small packet which contained the letter that he received from home just that morning.  "From bad to worse", he thought.  The small amount of pocket change his parents had been able to send him throughout his first five years at the College of Magic had been barely enough for him to get by. Merry's last year at the College would be a dire one indeed now that his parents could not even afford to send that precious small pittance. Surely, there was some way he could make things easier on himself, he was a talented magician after all, even if he had yet to graduate.  What would be the harm in using a little magic now and then?  Everyone else did, once in a while, even if it was forbidden, and wasn't the use of comfort charms enchanted by someone else  just as bad as using magic?  Merry certainly thought so. 
	"Hey you!", shouted a particularly tall student in the group before him. "Make yourself useful and fetch us all of the books by Aldous Burnside." Now that the tall boy had drawn attention to him all of the students at the table were looking his way.
	"That's not my job", Merry said.
	"What are they paying you for then?", asked another one of the group, a ruddy boy with eyes too close together and a slightly upturned nose. Merry recognized him. He was the grandson of one of the council members that governed the College of Mages. Not someone to pick a fight with.
	Merry tried his best to shrug it off and ignore them, but as he turned his back the tall boy waved his hand and the stack of books Merry was working on flew off of the shelf and landed with a bang.
	Merry turned to face his antagonizers, a malicious spell forming in his mind. Just before he let out the words that would probably put the whole group in the infirmary for a week, he regained control. Merry knew that he would certainly be expelled if he injured the council members grandson, so he turned to the pile of books laying on the floor, and with a flick of his wrist the books floated back to position on the shelf.
