	Merry mopped his forehead and cursed silently under his breath.  The library was hot and Merry had worked up quite a sweat moving large heavy stacks of books from one shelf to another.  He glanced up at the sound of laughter from a group of students at the table directly across from him.  Immediately self conscious, he smoothed his damp, fair hair, which at this moment resembled a bale of straw,  and hoped his face was not too flushed pink with heat.  He sighed, relieved as he realized the students in front of him appeared not to have noticed him.  They appeared not to notice the stifling heat in the library as well.  No doubt, they all possessed atmosphere charms that made the air around them cool and comfortable. The ingredients to make such charms were expensive, and Merry could not afford such as an extravagance. He could not afford to attend the School either. Merry knew that if it weren't for the scholarship he had earned six years ago when he had impressed the School of Magic with his unusual abilities, that he would never have been able to even enter the prestigious library of magic.  He supposed he should be grateful that he was even here at all, serving as an assistant to the librarian of the school of magic.   Professor McQuillen was one of the most respected magicians in the world and possessed a vast amount of knowledge of the history of magic.  Merry knew he should be appreciative of the opportunity to even be near such a man but at the moment, all he could think about was how hard the librarian made him work. 
	Glaring at the group of students gathered at the table not ten feet in front of him, Merry realized he was jealous.  And why shouldn't he be?  They seemed to have such an effortless existence, plenty of gold as well as a comfort charm for every occasion. Though they were forbidden from using magic for ordinary chores,  as was Merry, he knew that they had far fewer chores than he did.  And what chores they did complete were no doubt made much more comfortable by the expensive charms that their wealthy parents had provided them with.  Their parents, too could afford to send them large monthly allowances that they spent quickly every night at the expensive entertainment establishments that cropped up near the school to cater to the students.
	 Merry's family was far from wealthy.  Minor nobility and landowners though they were, the farm was barely prosperous and the drought this past summer ensured that  they were even worse off than before. Merry's hands slipped into the pocket of his coat and touched the small packet which contained the letter that he received from home just that morning. The small amount of pocket change his mother had been able to send him throughout his first five years at the College of Magic had been barely enough for him to get by. Merry's last year at the College would be a dire one indeed now that she could not even afford to send that precious small pittance. Surely, there was some way he could make things easier on himself, he was a talented magician after all, even if he had yet to graduate.  What would be the harm in using a little magic now and then?  Everyone else did, once in a while, even if it was forbidden, and wasn't the use of comfort charms enchanted by someone else  just as bad as using magic?  Merry certainly thought so. 
	"Hey you!", shouted a particularly tall student in the group before him. "Stop staring at us and make yourself useful Fetch us all of the books by Aldous Burnside." Now that the tall boy had drawn attention to him all of the students at the table were looking his way.  Merry's eyes narrowed.  Who did these students think they were?  Mere sophomores, by the looks of them, and certainly not the scholarly type.  Merry knew without a doubt his magic was far superior to any one of them, charms or not.  
	"That's not my job", he said and did not avert his eyes.  
	"What are they paying you for then?", asked another one of the group, a ruddy boy with eyes too close together and a slightly upturned nose. Merry recognized him. He was Simon Godard, the grandson of one of the council members that governed the College of Mages.  Merry turned his back, sighed deeply and tried to ignore him as he returned to work on the large stack of books.  Simon was not someone to pick a fight with.  But as he lifted his hand to take a large volume from the pile, the ruddy boy waved his hand and the stack of books Merry was working on flew off  the shelf and landed with a loud bang. 
	 Merry angrily turned to face his antagonizers, "You don't know who you're dealing with", he said, in a low voice, his mind involuntarily forming the beginnings of a malicious spell. Just before the words tumbled out of his mouth that would have likely put the whole group in the infirmary for a week, he regained control and clamped his mouth shut.  Merry knew that he would certainly be expelled if he injured Councilman Godard's grandson, so he turned to the books scattered on the floor, and with a flick of his wrist the stack rearranged itself and floated back to position on the shelf.  Simon laughed and raised his hand as if to strew Merry's work once more but hastily lowered it as he noticed Professor McQuillen looking in his direction.  
	Simon's ruddy face grew even redder, and his mouth froze in horror as Professor McQuillen hurried over to the table.  "What is this!" shouted the Professor.  "Godard!" he shouted, "You know full well that magic is against school policy."  He waved his hands dismissively.  "Out!  All of you!"   The group of sophomores hurriedly gathered up their books and quickly disappeared out the door, almost as if by magic.  
	"And you.." Professor McQuillen began, looking hard at Merry.  "What do you think you were doing? You used magic, too."
	"But-" sputtered Merry, "They-"
	"Yes, I know," said the Professor, not unkindly.  "You used magic to restore the work they ruined.  But still, Meriwether, you should have known better.  It's against the rules and besides, it will make you lazy.  Magicians must use magic wisely, never for petty reasons."
	"But was I to allow them to ruin all my hard hours of work?  That hardly seems fair!"  Merry's eyebrows rose and disappeared in the forelock of fair hair that hung above them.  
	"You could have asked them to pick up the mess they made.  With their hands, of course"  said Professor McQuillen, his eyes looking large and wise behind his spectacles.  "That would have been the proper response."  he added. 
	"Of course sir," Merry admitted, but his hands curled into fists inside the pockets of his coat and his fingernails dug marks into his palms .
***
	The envelope was labeled, "Meriwether ___"  and was wedged inside the doorframe to his small room.  He ripped into it, too curious to bother with being careful.  Inside the envelope were two small squares of paper.  One looked like an invitation of some sort, the other, clearly a map.  Merry flung himself onto his bed and began to read:
				Dear Mr. ____,
			 	 I am a small shopkeeper with need of an assistant.  I believe you may find this 	position to be financially rewarding.  Please meet with me at my clothier shop before dawn 	tomorrow and we will discuss my proposition.  For the courtesy of meeting with me, a gold piece 	will be provided.  
																							Sincerely,
										      Mr. William Denton

	Merry tossed the note onto his bed and turned his attention to the map.   What could this possibly be about?  Merry was skeptical, what would a clothier want with his assistance?  He had never heard of a William Denton and didn't know anything about clothing,  tailoring or shopkeeping.  Could the shopkeeper want his services for some kind of illegal magic?  He'd heard of hedge wizards before, low life magicians who performed magical services for money.  It was definitely a shady sort of business and poor or not, Merry did not want to become involved in something  that might get him expelled from school or worse.  His family had invested too much in his schooling.  He knew he should be at home, working the farm, helping his mother with the difficult chores.  Since his father had died and he was the oldest son, it was his duty, but his mother had insisted.  She wouldn't hear of him staying at home, not when she knew he had so much talent.  And so, with his uncle's help, he'd procured a scholarship to the school of magic and here he was, the pinnacle of his family's hopes and dreams. 
	But still, Mr. Denton did promise a gold piece for his trouble and he could definitely use that gold piece.  He could hear the man out and if he were asked to do anything other than legitimate work, he could always refuse.  Besides, it might even turn out to be a legitimate job offer and he'd be foolish not to at least find out.  The shop seemed to be a small distance away.  Not too far, but if he were to be there before dawn, he'd have to wake up awfully early and the road would be dark. Was it really worth it  for the promise of a gold piece and a vague hope of a job?  Merry reached beside him for the note he had discarded.  His fingers found only a pile of dust.  He glanced at the map still in his hand, committing it to memory, then let it slide from his fingers.  A sprinkling of dust fell upon his chest.   It was an enchanted letter, made to disappear as soon as it was out of it's recipient's grasp.  Merry knew he would leave early the next morning, whether the stars were out to light his path or not, to seek out this Mr. Denton.  He was curious.  
****
	The small clothing shop looked ordinary enough.  Merry knocked on the door and waited, listening to the crow of a rooster as dawn began to break in the sky.  The shop seemed dark and no one answered.  He half-hoped no one would.   After knocking several more times and hearing no sounds of stirring inside, he began to grow irritated.  He placed a hand upon the door knob  and to his amazement it opened.  The door swung silently into the shop and Merry was greeted by a rush of warmth and light and the fragrance of new cloth and something else, oil and machinery.   He entered the shop and listened, hearing nothing.  At last, he heard the sound of footsteps, seemingly coming from far away, and then closer.  A small grey man appeared. 
	 "Hello Meriwether" he said, pleasantly.  "I knew you'd come."  He clasped Merry's hand with both his own. "For your trouble, just as I promised."  He released Merry's hand, leaving a gold piece in his palm.  "I am Mr. Denton, and what brings you here?" 
	"What brings me here?  Why, you did, of course. I got your letter. "  Merry replied as his eyebrows drew together, nearly meeting in the middle. 
	"Ah yes, but besides that?  What brings you here?  Why did you come? "   Mr. Denton looked at him waiting for an answer.  
	"I need money," said Merry, "and I was curious. I wanted to know what a tailor could possibly want from me."
	"You can't find the answer because you're asking the wrong question. I am more than a mere tailor. If you'll come with me I'll explain." Mr. Denton moved towards the back of his shop past bolts of expensive looking material, and brushed aside a curtain guarding a small room. He motioned for Merry to go in first.
	The room was barely big enough to hold the upright glass display case and the two men now standing in it.  On the first shelf of the display was an impressive row of cufflinks, studded with jewels of all sorts.  The second shelf held row after row of gold and silver watches with chains thick and thin.    Merry stared intently at the display of pocket watches as Mr. Denton pulled the doors of the case open. Merry had seen a pocket watch before, but never so many in one place and never so finely crafted. Merry wondered where Mr. Denton had acquired such a large collection of these rare inventions and if the College of Mages knew about them.  The magician's council discouraged the use of mechanical devices in the realm since they were said to be dangerous.   Merry suspected, though, that  the real reason was because magicians were paid well to create charms and magical spells and mass produced inventions that could do almost the same thing would ruin their livelihoods.   
	Mr. Denton waved his hand toward the display of watches, "Go ahead, pick one out."
	"Pick one out?" Merry's eyebrows wrinkled.  
	"You don't have one already do you?" His faded blue eyes looked amused. 
	"Uh, no, but I...I'm afraid I haven't the means-" Merry stammered. 
	"Take one, as a gift."  The older man nodded, his unruly tufts of grey hair bobbing. 	Merry blinked. A smile spread over his face and he turned toward the timepieces.  The smile turned to a frown as he thought over what the man had said.  "Why?" he asked.  
	"My gift, as I said before.  Go ahead, you want one don't you?"  Mr. Denton smiled, exposing teeth yellowed with age. Though he felt uneasy, knowing that things that were too good to be true probably were, Merry's hands reached into the cabinet and he moved to examine the display more closely.  A  plain golden watch with a slender gold chain caught his eye.  He lifted it out of the case and noticed the back was clear glass, exposing an assortment of gears and springs.  Merry was fascinated.  The watch seemed alive, somehow, the mechanisms vibrating with barely perceptible movement.
	"This is your choice, then?" The shopkeeper took the watch from Merry's hand, not waiting for an answer.   "A fine choice, indeed. " he said, sounding pleased.  The watch spun slowly on it's chain as Mr. Denton dangled it in his outstretched hand.  He grabbed the watch with his other hand and dropped it in Merry's pocket.  "So you like my timepieces, eh?" his faded blue eyes twinkled.  "Watches are just one of the many special things I sell." he said.  "Would you like to see some of the uh, the more exotic items?"  Merry nodded wondering what other fascinating devices the shopkeeper might have in his shop.   Mr. Denton led him toward the back of the shop until he reached a small door with a desk in front of it.  The older man pushed the desk out of the way and opened the door.  Merry could see a narrow twisting staircase leading into a dark cellar.  The older man took a candle from the desk, nodded to it, and immediately, a bright yellow flame sprang to life.   Motioning for Merry to follow, the shopkeeper started down the stairs.  Merry felt a cold prickle of sweat forming on the back of his neck though the air in the cellar was cool.  Maybe this wasn't such a good idea following a total stranger into a cellar.  Still, he continued, wondering what kind of goods the man had in his cellar and what kind of assistance he wanted from him.   
	Mr. Denton led Merry down the stairs,  into the darkness, stopping at a flat stone in the middle of the cellar floor.  He knelt down and lifted the stone, tossing it aside onto the dusty floor with a soft echoing thump.  The older man then stood, and with the toe of his boot,  scraped at the soft earth underneath where the stone had been.   A vortex of dust began to form rising higher and higher until Merry coughed slightly.  Then the dust gathered itself into a neat heap just in front of Merry's toes, revealing a rectangular wooden door in the earthen floor.   Mr. Denton stooped and lifted the door which opened stiffly with a creaking sound as though it hadn't been opened in a very long time.  The cellar was filled with stale but warm air and a curious pale light glowed from the opening and  limned the man's riotous grey head with silver.
	  "Wait." he said. His eyes glinted steel blue in the dim light as he looked up at Merry.  "You must promise that you will never reveal what you are about to see."  Merry's heart skipped a beat as he contemplated the wisdom of entering the secret chamber of a seemingly mad magician.  Sensing the boy's hesitation, the shopkeeper turned to Merry and smiled.  "All is well,"he said, patting Merry's shoulder.  Merry drew in his breath sharply, with an audible gasp and gaped at the old man.  How could he know?  How could this strange little tailor know how his father had said those very same words?  Merry could hear that familiar voice in his mind, even though it had been years since he'd last heard his father say, "All is well."  and pat him reassuringly on the back.  As a child, that gesture had so comforted Merry whenever he'd been afraid.   He could still feel the weight of Mr. Denton's hand on his shoulder and it filled him with an odd mix of grief and warmth.  Who was this man?  Merry searched his face, hoping to find answers,  but it lay in the shadows now.  "All is well," the shopkeeper said again, gently. 
	Merry nodded, wordless,  and followed him down into the dimly lit darkness.  Mr. Denton led him through a series of tunnels in what appeared to be an abandoned section of catacombs.  At last, he stopped in front of a pale, glowing crystal hanging from the chiseled ceiling.  He tapped the crystal with his gnarled finger and it flickered and dimmed.
"Can you recharge this crystal, Merry?" he asked.  
	"Of course." Merry said and grasped the dying crystal, wrapping it  with his palm.  The crystal began to glow brighter and brighter as living energy flowed from his hand into the mineral.  Merry removed his hand and then smiled, his teeth gleaming as the brilliant crystal lit up the catacombs as bright as daylight.  
	"Do you need to sit a minute?" asked Mr. Denton as Merry blinked.	"Oh, no, I'm fine, now, really. " said Merry, and he was.  The momentary feeling of dizziness had now given way to euphoria and Merry felt strong and sure footed.  
	"You must be very powerful.   Very powerful, indeed." said Mr. Denton, impressed.  "Enchantments can really be demanding for a magician but you seem to have recovered with remarkable speed."    Merry grinned, pleased with the older man's praise.    
	As his eyes adjusted to the light, Merry noticed the tunnel was filled with objects.  Shiny metallic tools and oily gears and machinery hung upon every wall of the earthen corridors.  Crates and boxes lay piled up to the ceiling along the sides leaving only a narrow pathway in which to walk.  "What is this?"  Merry asked, his mouth agape.  He had never seen so much steel before.
	"This," said Mr. Denton waving his hand, "Is the future."  
(picks up some kind of machinery, etc. and demonstrates it and they discuss it.  Tells Merry to think it over and make his decision and let him know tomorrow.  Merry worries about being expelled, Mr. Denton reassures him that no one will find out. 
Q2
 		Later that evening, after school was over for the day, Merry sat, chewing his turkey leg thoughtfully.  He'd decided to treat himself to a nice dinner at the Dirk and Thistle, a local tavern that he scarcely ever visited.   He took a sip of ale from the heavy tankard and wiped his lips with his sleeve.  Dinner usually consisted of stale bread and cheese eaten alone in his little room off the library corridor.   If he took the position as Denton's assistant, meals like this one could become commonplace.   		




	Merry whistled cheerfully to himself as he started down the path from Mr. Denton's shop.  The gold piece felt cool and heavy in his hand; it had been a long time since he'd been in possession of so much money and he was beside himself with excitement as the possibilities flashed in his mind.  He briefly considered hiring one of the horse drawn cabs parked on the street to take him back to the college, but decided he didn't dare risk making the other students aware of his sudden windfall.  It was better to walk home as usual.   
	He passed by a gun shop and lingered by the door. Trying to peer inside, he looked more like a child about to unwrap a gift than a powerful magician to be. He was giddy with the anticipation of firing one of the devices; he might even have enough money to buy a small pistol.  But, Merry reminded himself, the Chancellor of Magic had forbidden magicians from owning guns, and Merry doubted that the gunsmith would even want a student of the College of Magic in his shop. He wondered if maybe Mr. Denton would let him fire his gun, that is if Merry decided to accept his offer.   
	At the other end of the square, tucked away in the shade of a tall black walnut tree was a small brick store front that housed a charm shop. Merry hurried towards the open door, his lips curving into a smile as he imagined the glittering display of enchanted talismans.  He could buy an atmosphere charm so he could enjoy the comfort of a cool breeze in the summer, or the warm radiance of a fire in the winter.  He could buy a charm to lighten the heavy load of his books. He could even buy a charm to protect him from the city's frequent rain showers. Just as Merry was about to succumb to the pull of the enchanted shop, he stumbled on an old walnut husk and nearly lost his balance. The jolt snapped him back to reality and he thought better of spending his money so quickly. He would need it soon for necessities.  He dropped the coin back into his pocket where it landed with a soft clink against his new watch.   Merry tugged on the thin gold chain and the watch emerged and glinted in the sunlight.  Such a beautiful device.  His fingers traced the gears in the transparent case.  As he stared at the hands slowly tracing the path of time, he realized he was about to be late to class.  He'd been so giddy with the excitement of the morning, he forgot he had to hurry on to school.   In fact, he'd all but forgotten school.  He jammed the watch back into his pocket and picked up his pace. 
	Merry arrived breathlessly to class and plopped himself down in his seat.  The  euphoria he'd felt earlier began to dissolve into confusion as he contemplated the choice he had to make.   Deciding to concentrate on his studies and worry about decision making later, he buried his face in his book and sighed, his fingers deep in his pocket, twined around the thin gold chain of his watch.   Maybe what he needed was a nice meal at the Dirk and Thistle tavern, a full, satisfied stomach might help him focus.
